Title: Add `CHANNEL-CODE` Field to Transaction File for Channel Identification in Batch Processing and Reporting

User Story:
As a COBOL developer,
I want to add a `CHANNEL-CODE` field to the transaction file,
so that the source of each transaction (e.g., ATM, Mobile, Branch) can be captured and processed,
allowing for improved analytics, auditing, and fraud detection based on transaction channels through batch processing and reporting.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Definition
   A new field `CHANNEL-CODE` (`PIC X(04)`) is defined in the relevant copybooks (e.g., `TRANSACTION.CPY`).

2. File Layout
   Transaction input and output files are updated to include the `CHANNEL-CODE` field and corresponding layout adjustments.

3. Program Updates
   All programs (batch, online, utility) that read or write transaction data are updated to handle the new field appropriately.

4. Test Data
   Sample input files and test data include valid `CHANNEL-CODE` values (e.g., `BRCH`, `ATM`, `MOBL`, `NETB`).

5. LRECL & FD Adjustments
   The LRECL (Logical Record Length) and FD (File Description) entries in COBOL programs and JCL are adjusted to reflect the new field.

6. Documentation
   The data dictionary and all relevant documentation are updated to reflect the structure and purpose of `CHANNEL-CODE`.

7. Reporting
   Any reports or logs that output transaction details include the `CHANNEL-CODE` field where applicable.

## Summary

**User Story:**  
Add `CHANNEL-CODE` Field to Transaction File for Channel Identification in Batch Processing and Reporting  
- A new field `CHANNEL-CODE` (`PIC X(04)`) is to be added to the transaction file and all related copybooks, programs, and reports.  
- All programs that read/write transaction data, as well as reporting and batch processing modules, must be updated to handle the new field.  
- LRECL and FD entries must be adjusted, and test data and documentation updated accordingly.

**Total Impacted Components:** 8 (COBOL programs and copybooks directly or indirectly handling transaction data and reporting)

**Change Complexity:**  
High. This change affects core data structures (copybooks), file layouts, multiple batch and reporting programs, and requires updates to both code and JCL. The ripple effect is broad due to the centrality of transaction data in the system.

**Reasoning:**  
- The `TRANSACTION.CPY` (or `TRNREC`) copybook is the central structure for transaction data and must be updated first.  
- All programs that read/write transaction data (RPTPOS00, UTLVAL00, TSTGEN00, TSTVAL00) are directly impacted and must be updated to handle the new field, including file layout and logic changes.
- Reporting and audit programs (RPTPOS00, RPTAUD00) must include the new field in outputs.
- JCL scripts for these jobs must be updated for new LRECL and DD statements.
- POSREC.CPY may require alignment if it is used in conjunction with transaction data in reporting/validation.
- The impact is broad and touches both code and operational scripts, with high risk if not coordinated across all affected components.

# Technical Document and Low-Level Design (LLD)

## 1. Introduction  
This document provides a comprehensive technical overview and Low-Level Design (LLD) for the enhancement of the COBOL Legacy Benchmark Suite. The enhancement introduces a new `CHANNEL-CODE` field to the transaction file and all related components, enabling the identification of transaction sources (e.g., ATM, Mobile, Branch) for improved analytics, auditing, and fraud detection. The document details the existing logic, the rationale and scope of the change, and precise implementation guidance.

## 2. Existing Logic and Flow  
### 2.1 Overview  
The COBOL application processes business-critical transaction data in batch and reporting modules. The core flow consists of:

- **Initialization:** Opening files, reading copybook layouts, and preparing data structures.
- **Processing:** Reading transaction records, applying business rules, generating reports, and performing validations.
- **Termination:** Writing output files, closing resources, and logging results.

### 2.2 Detailed Logic  
#### Key Components:
- **TRANSACTION.CPY / TRNREC:** Central copybook defining the transaction record structure.
- **RPTPOS00:** Batch reporting program reading transaction files and generating reports.
- **UTLVAL00:** Batch validation program for transaction files.
- **TSTGEN00:** Utility for generating test transaction data.
- **TSTVAL00:** Utility for validating test data.
- **RPTAUD00:** Audit reporting program.
- **POSREC.CPY:** Copybook used in reporting/validation.
- **JCL:** Job Control Language scripts defining file layouts and LRECL.

#### Example: Transaction Processing Flow (RPTPOS00)
- **1100-OPEN-FILES:** Opens transaction input and report output files.
- **2200-PROCESS-TRANSACTIONS:** Reads each transaction record, applies business rules, and writes to report.
- **Termination:** Closes files and writes summary.

#### Flowchart:

    ProcessTransaction --> WriteReport
    WriteReport --> NextRecord
    NextRecord -- Yes --> ReadTransaction
    NextRecord -- No --> CloseFiles
    CloseFiles --> End
```

#### Example: Transaction Record Structure (TRANSACTION.CPY)
```cobol
01  TRANSACTION-RECORD.
    05  TRANSACTION-ID         PIC X(10).
    05  ACCOUNT-NUMBER         PIC X(12).
    05  TRANSACTION-AMOUNT     PIC 9(9)V99.
    05  TRANSACTION-DATE       PIC X(08).
    05  TRANSACTION-TYPE       PIC X(02).
    * ... other fields ...
```

## 3. Proposed Changes  
### 3.1 User Story or Analysis Report Summary  
**User Story:**  
Add a `CHANNEL-CODE` field (`PIC X(04)`) to the transaction file and all related copybooks, programs, and reports. All programs that read/write transaction data, as well as reporting and batch processing modules, must be updated to handle the new field. LRECL and FD entries must be adjusted, and test data and documentation updated accordingly.

- **TSTGEN00:** Update to generate test data with `CHANNEL-CODE`.
- **TSTVAL00:** Update to validate test data with `CHANNEL-CODE`.
- **RPTAUD00:** Update to include `CHANNEL-CODE` in audit reports.
- **POSREC.CPY:** Align structure if used with transaction data.
- **JCL (RPTPOS00, UTLVAL00, TSTGEN00, TSTVAL00):** Update LRECL and DD statements for new field.

- **Purpose of Changes:**  
  To capture the source channel of each transaction, enabling improved analytics, auditing, and fraud detection.

- **Impact:**  
  Broad changes to core data structures, file layouts, batch/reporting programs, and operational scripts. All transaction-handling logic must be aware of the new field. Test data and documentation must be updated.

### 3.3 Insertion Points  
- **TRANSACTION.CPY / TRNREC:**  
  - Add `05 CHANNEL-CODE PIC X(04).` at the appropriate position in the record layout.
- **RPTPOS00, UTLVAL00, TSTGEN00, TSTVAL00, RPTAUD00:**  
  - Update FD (File Description) sections to include `CHANNEL-CODE`.
  - Update record reading/writing logic to handle the new field.
  - Update report layouts and output logic to display `CHANNEL-CODE`.
- **POSREC.CPY:**  
  - Align structure if it references transaction data.
- **JCL:**  
  - Update LRECL in DD statements to reflect the new record length.

#### Example Insertion Points:
- **TRANSACTION.CPY:** After the last existing field in the transaction record.
- **RPTPOS00:** In FD section and in the report-writing paragraph.
- **UTLVAL00:** In FD section and in validation logic.
- **TSTGEN00:** In test data generation logic.
- **TSTVAL00:** In test data validation logic.
- **RPTAUD00:** In audit report output logic.

### 3.4 Structured Diffs  

#### TRANSACTION.CPY / TRNREC

**Before:**
```cobol
01  TRANSACTION-RECORD.
    05  TRANSACTION-ID         PIC X(10).
    05  ACCOUNT-NUMBER         PIC X(12).
    05  TRANSACTION-AMOUNT     PIC 9(9)V99.
    05  TRANSACTION-DATE       PIC X(08).
    05  TRANSACTION-TYPE       PIC X(02).
    * ... other fields ...
```

**After:**
```cobol
01  TRANSACTION-RECORD.
    05  TRANSACTION-ID         PIC X(10).
    05  ACCOUNT-NUMBER         PIC X(12).
    05  TRANSACTION-AMOUNT     PIC 9(9)V99.
    05  TRANSACTION-DATE       PIC X(08).
    05  TRANSACTION-TYPE       PIC X(02).
    * ... other fields ...
    05  CHANNEL-CODE           PIC X(04).
```

#### RPTPOS00, UTLVAL00, TSTGEN00, TSTVAL00, RPTAUD00 (FD Section)

**Before:**
```cobol
FD  TRANSACTION-FILE
    RECORD CONTAINS 42 CHARACTERS
    BLOCK CONTAINS 0 RECORDS
    DATA RECORD IS TRANSACTION-RECORD.
```

**After:**
```cobol
FD  TRANSACTION-FILE
    RECORD CONTAINS 46 CHARACTERS
    BLOCK CONTAINS 0 RECORDS
    DATA RECORD IS TRANSACTION-RECORD.
```
*(Assuming the previous record length was 42 and the new field adds 4 characters)*

#### Reading/Writing Logic

**Before:**
```cobol
READ TRANSACTION-FILE INTO TRANSACTION-RECORD
    AT END
        SET END-OF-FILE TO TRUE.
```

**After:**
```cobol
READ TRANSACTION-FILE INTO TRANSACTION-RECORD
    AT END
        SET END-OF-FILE TO TRUE.
* CHANNEL-CODE is now available in TRANSACTION-RECORD
```

#### Report Output

**Before:**
```cobol
MOVE TRANSACTION-ID TO REPORT-TRANSACTION-ID
MOVE ACCOUNT-NUMBER TO REPORT-ACCOUNT-NUMBER
* ... other moves ...
WRITE REPORT-RECORD
```

**After:**
```cobol
MOVE TRANSACTION-ID TO REPORT-TRANSACTION-ID
MOVE ACCOUNT-NUMBER TO REPORT-ACCOUNT-NUMBER
* ... other moves ...
MOVE CHANNEL-CODE TO REPORT-CHANNEL-CODE
WRITE REPORT-RECORD
```

#### JCL (DD Statement)

**Before:**
```jcl
//TRANIN   DD  DSN=TRANSACTION.INPUT,DISP=SHR,LRECL=42,RECFM=FB
```

**After:**
```jcl
//TRANIN   DD  DSN=TRANSACTION.INPUT,DISP=SHR,LRECL=46,RECFM=FB
```

#### Test Data

**Before:**
```
0000000001ACC00000000100020230101DP
```

**After:**
```
0000000001ACC00000000100020230101DPATM
```
*(Where 'ATM' is a sample CHANNEL-CODE value, padded as needed)*

## 4. Conclusion  
The addition of the `CHANNEL-CODE` field to the transaction file and all related components enables the system to capture and process the source of each transaction. This enhancement supports improved analytics, auditing, and fraud detection. The changes impact core data structures, batch and reporting programs, test data, and operational scripts. All affected modules must be updated in a coordinated manner to ensure data integrity and system reliability.
