Hello,

To proceed with the comprehensive technical documentation and Low-Level Design (LLD) for the COBOL application at [https://github.com/sentientsergio/COBOL-Legacy-Benchmark-Suite](https://github.com/sentientsergio/COBOL-Legacy-Benchmark-Suite), I need the specific user story or analysis report that outlines the required enhancements or modifications. This information is crucial for:

- Identifying the impacted modules and code sections
- Determining insertion points for new logic or changes
- Preparing accurate structured diffs
- Ensuring the LLD aligns with the business and technical requirements

Could you please provide the detailed user story, business requirements, or analysis report describing the changes to be made? Once I have this, I can accurately document the impacted areas and proceed with the LLD as required.

Thank you!
