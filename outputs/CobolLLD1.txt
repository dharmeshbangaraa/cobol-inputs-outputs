There is currently no specific user story or analysis report describing the required changes to be made to the COBOL application in the repository https://github.com/sentientsergio/COBOL-Legacy-Benchmark-Suite. To proceed with creating a technical document and Low-Level Design (LLD), I need a clear statement of the business requirements, enhancements, or user stories that outline the changes to be implemented. Please provide the relevant user story, business requirements document, or analysis report so that the documentation and design can accurately reflect the intended modifications. Without this information, it is not possible to detail the changes needed or provide guidance on their implementation.
