[Summary of the modification]
- File 2: RPTAUD00.cbl (src/programs/batch/RPTAUD00.cbl)
- Added inline comments in 2300-WRITE-SUMMARY to indicate that all P&L values must be rounded using ROUNDED in MOVE/COMPUTE statements. If P&L fields are present in the summary logic, ROUNDED should be applied. No explicit P&L field was found in the provided code, so comments were added for future maintainers.
