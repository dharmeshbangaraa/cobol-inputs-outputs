The required COBOL files for modification—specifically 'src/programs/calc/PNL-CALC-PROG.cbl' and potentially others—cannot be found in the provided GitHub repository ('COBOL-Legacy-Benchmark-Suite') under the specified paths or any alternative locations after exhaustive search. As a result, I am unable to retrieve, analyze, or modify the impacted COBOL source files as instructed. Please verify the file paths, repository name, or provide the correct repository access so I can perform the precise, traceable COBOL code modifications as required by the Impact Analysis Report.
