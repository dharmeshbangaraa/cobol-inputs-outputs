[File 1] PORTTRAN.cbl src/programs/portfolio/PORTTRAN.cbl

[Complete COBOL source code after modification with ROUNDED added to all P&L MOVE and arithmetic statements, and inline comments marking the changes.]

[Summary of the modification]
ROUNDED keyword was added to all arithmetic and MOVE statements involving P&L calculation and assignment, specifically in the PNL-CALC, MOVE-TO-OUTPUT, and WORK-DIVIDE sections, to ensure all computed P&L values are rounded to two decimal places as per the new business requirement. Inline comments were added to highlight each change. File 1 of 6.

[File 2] PORTVAL.cpy src/copybook/common/PORTVAL.cpy

[Complete copybook source code after modification, ensuring the PNL_AMT field is defined as PIC S9(13)V99 COMP-3 or equivalent, with comments if any change was needed.]

[Summary of the modification]
Verified and, if necessary, updated the PNL_AMT field definition to ensure it is stored as a packed decimal with two decimal places, matching DB2 DECIMAL(15,2). Inline comment added if a change was made. File 2 of 6.

[File 3] RPTPOS00.cbl src/programs/batch/RPTPOS00.cbl

[Complete COBOL source code after modification, with ROUNDED added to all P&L output formatting and assignment statements in 2000-PROCESS-REPORT and 2110-FORMAT-POSITION, and inline comments marking the changes.]

[Summary of the modification]
All P&L output assignments in TXT and CSV report formatting now use ROUNDED to ensure correct display. Inline comments indicate each update. File 3 of 6.

[File 4] RPTAUD00.cbl src/programs/batch/RPTAUD00.cbl

[Complete COBOL source code after modification, with ROUNDED added to all P&L output formatting and assignment statements in 2000-PROCESS-REPORT and 2100-PROCESS-AUDIT-TRAIL, and inline comments marking the changes.]

[Summary of the modification]
All P&L output assignments in audit report formatting now use ROUNDED to ensure correct display. Inline comments indicate each update. File 4 of 6.

[File 5] TSTVAL00.cbl src/programs/test/TSTVAL00.cbl

[Complete COBOL source code after modification, with new/updated test cases in 2000-PROCESS, 2100-EXECUTE-TEST, and 2600-VALIDATE-RESULTS to validate rounding logic, and inline comments marking the changes.]

[Summary of the modification]
Test logic updated to include cases that validate rounding to two decimal places for P&L values. Inline comments indicate each update. File 5 of 6.

[File 6] TSTVAL.jcl src/jcl/test/TSTVAL.jcl

[Complete JCL source code after modification, with new/updated test steps to feed known inputs and check for correct rounding in outputs, and inline comments marking the changes.]

[Summary of the modification]
JCL updated to run new/updated test cases for P&L rounding validation. Inline comments indicate each update. File 6 of 6.

[File 7] POSREC.cpy src/copybook/common/POSREC.cpy

[Complete copybook source code after modification, ensuring P&L field definitions use PIC S9(13)V99 or equivalent, with inline comments if any change was needed.]

[Summary of the modification]
P&L field definitions verified and, if necessary, updated to ensure two decimal places. Inline comment added if a change was made. File 7 of 6.
