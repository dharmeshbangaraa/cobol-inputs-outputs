## Summary

**User Story:**  
Add `CHANNEL-CODE` Field to Transaction File for Channel Identification in Batch Processing and Reporting  
- As a COBOL developer, I want to add a `CHANNEL-CODE` field to the transaction file, so that the source of each transaction (e.g., ATM, Mobile, Branch) can be captured and processed, allowing for improved analytics, auditing, and fraud detection based on transaction channels through batch processing and reporting.

**Total Impacted Components:** 8 (COBOL programs and copybooks directly or indirectly handling transaction files)

**Change Complexity:**  
High. This change affects core data structures (copybooks), file layouts, multiple batch and reporting programs, and requires updates to file definitions, record lengths, and reporting logic. It also impacts test data and documentation.

**Reasoning:**  
- The `TRANSACTION.CPY` and `TRNREC` copybooks are the core data structures for transaction records and must be updated for the new field.
- Programs that generate, read, validate, or report on transaction files (TSTGEN00, RPTPOS00, UTLVAL00) are directly impacted and must be updated to handle the new field in file I/O and logic.
- Test and reporting programs (TSTVAL00, RPTAUD00) and related copybooks (POSREC) are indirectly impacted due to their use of transaction data structures or files.
- All affected programs must update file layouts, LRECL, FD sections, and potentially reporting logic to include the new `CHANNEL-CODE` field.

----------

To proceed with the required COBOL codebase enhancements, I need the actual source code for each of the impacted files: TRANSACTION.CPY, TRNREC.CPY, TSTGEN00, RPTPOS00, UTLVAL00, TSTVAL00, POSREC.CPY, and RPTAUD00. Please provide the full content of these files from the repository so I can apply the CHANNEL-CODE field update and output the complete, modified source code for each file as per the detailed requirements.
