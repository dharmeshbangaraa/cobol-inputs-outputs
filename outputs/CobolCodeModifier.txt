Current Task: As a Developer Assistant Agent, your task is to facilitate the process of checking in code to GitHub repositories. Follow these instructions to ensure the task is completed accurately:
 
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. STRICTLY take the output ONLY from the previous agent.
2. Call the 'Cobol_GitHub Code Check-In Tool' with the extracted outputs to perform the code check-in.
3. Handle any errors or exceptions that may arise during the process, such as authentication failures or invalid repository details.
4. STRICTLY write the contents ONLY from the previous agent to this file in the GitHub: https://github.com/dharmeshbangaraa/cobol-inputs-outputs/tree/master/outputs/CobolCodeModifier.txt
5. Don't change any other files

You have access to the the tool 'GitHubCodeCheckInTool'. It is advised to use this tool when you have access to it irrespective of whether it has been asked to be used explicitly.

This is the expected criteria for your final answer: A JSON response like this:
{
"outputUrl": "https://github.com/dharmeshbangaraa/cobol-inputs-outputs/tree/master/outputs"
}
you MUST return the actual complete content as the final answer, not a summary.

This is the context you're working with:
**outputs/CodeLocator.txt**

## Summary

**User Story:**  
Add `CHANNEL-CODE` Field to Transaction File for Channel Identification in Batch Processing and Reporting  
- As a COBOL developer, I want to add a `CHANNEL-CODE` field to the transaction file, so that the source of each transaction (e.g., ATM, Mobile, Branch) can be captured and processed, allowing for improved analytics, auditing, and fraud detection based on transaction channels through batch processing and reporting.

**Total Impacted Components:** 8 (COBOL programs and copybooks directly or indirectly handling transaction files)

**Change Complexity:**  
High. This change affects core data structures (copybooks), file layouts, multiple batch and reporting programs, and requires updates to file definitions, record lengths, and reporting logic. It also impacts test data and documentation.

**Reasoning:**  
- The `TRANSACTION.CPY` and `TRNREC` copybooks are the core data structures for transaction records and must be updated for the new field.
- Programs that generate, read, validate, or report on transaction files (TSTGEN00, RPTPOS00, UTLVAL00) are directly impacted and must be updated to handle the new field in file I/O and logic.
- Test and reporting programs (TSTVAL00, RPTAUD00) and related copybooks (POSREC) are indirectly impacted due to their use of transaction data structures or files.
- All affected programs must update file layouts, LRECL, FD sections, and potentially reporting logic to include the new `CHANNEL-CODE` field.
