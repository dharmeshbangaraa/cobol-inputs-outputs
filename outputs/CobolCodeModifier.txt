[Summary Change Report]
- Added new VSAM file PRICEHIST-FILE for historical price storage as required by the impact analysis.
- Introduced FD and file status for PRICEHIST.
- Opened and closed PRICEHIST-FILE in the appropriate paragraphs.
- Added new counter WS-HIST-PRICE-WRITTEN and displayed its value in the stats.
- Created new paragraph 2100-STORE-PRICEHIST to write historical price data to the new VSAM file, with traceable inline comments.
- Updated 2000-PROCESS to call 2100-STORE-PRICEHIST for each record.
- All changes are marked with *-- Change: for traceability and are minimally invasive, preserving original logic and formatting.
