**Reasoning**:

- `src/programs/batch/POSUPDT00.cbl` is the main entry for position and valuation updates, directly impacted by the need to ingest and process real-time prices, recalculate values, and handle errors.
- `src/programs/batch/HISTLD00.cbl` is responsible for storing historical price data, which is a new requirement for analysis and reporting.
- `src/programs/common/AUDPROC.cbl` is the audit processor, required for logging alerts and errors when the feed fails or data is stale.
- `src/copybook/common/POSREC.cpy` and `src/copybook/common/AUDITLOG.cpy` are shared data structures that must be extended or used by the above programs to support new fields and logging requirements.
