## Summary

**User Story:**  
Add `CHANNEL-CODE` Field to Transaction File for Channel Identification in Batch Processing and Reporting  
As a COBOL developer, I want to add a `CHANNEL-CODE` field to the transaction file, so that the source of each transaction (e.g., ATM, Mobile, Branch) can be captured and processed, allowing for improved analytics, auditing, and fraud detection based on transaction channels through batch processing and reporting.

**Total Impacted Components:** 8 COBOL programs (batch, reporting, utility), 2 copybooks, and associated JCL  
**Change Complexity:** High. This change affects core data structures (copybooks), file layouts, batch processing, reporting, and test data, requiring coordinated updates across multiple programs and artifacts.

**Reasoning:**  
- The `TRANSACTION.CPY` (or `TRNREC`) copybook is the central artifact for the transaction file structure. All programs that read or write transactions include this copybook and must be updated for the new field.
- Batch programs (`BCHCTL00`), reporting programs (`RPTPOS00`, `RPTAUD00`), validation utilities (`UTLVAL00`), and test programs (`TSTGEN00`, `TSTVAL00`) all interact with the transaction file and are directly or indirectly impacted.
- JCL scripts for these programs must be updated for LRECL and FD changes.
- Copybooks like `POSREC.CPY` may reference or be affected by the transaction structure.
- Impact scores are based on directness of dependency, business criticality, and likelihood of structural change.
