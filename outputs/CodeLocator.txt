User Story: Add Transaction Type Field to Batch Processing and Reporting
Title:
Add Transaction Type field to transaction processing and reporting in COBOL portfolio system

As a
Portfolio operations analyst

I want to
record and display the type of each transaction (e.g., BUY, SELL, DIVIDEND) in both processing and reporting programs

So that
I can track, analyze, and report on different types of portfolio transactions for compliance and business insights

Acceptance Criteria
Data Structure Update

Add a new field, TRANSACTION-TYPE (PIC X(10)), to the transaction record layout in the relevant copybook used by both the batch processing and reporting programs.

Batch Processing Program Update

Update the transaction processing COBOL program (e.g., TRNVAL00.cbl or similar) to:

Accept, store, and process the new transaction type field when reading or writing transaction records.

Reporting Program Update

Update the transaction report COBOL program (e.g., RPTPOS00.cbl or similar) to:

Read and display the transaction type in the generated summary report.

Backward Compatibility

If the transaction type is missing for older records, the programs should handle it gracefully (e.g., display as blank or "UNKNOWN" in reports).

## 1. Summary

**User Story:**  
_Add Transaction Type Field to Batch Processing and Reporting. As a Portfolio operations analyst, I want to record and display the type of each transaction (e.g., BUY, SELL, DIVIDEND) in both processing and reporting programs so that I can track, analyze, and report on different types of portfolio transactions for compliance and business insights._

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Add a new field, TRANSACTION-TYPE (PIC X(10)), to the transaction record layout in the relevant copybook used by both the batch processing and reporting programs.
2. Update the transaction processing COBOL program (e.g., TRNVAL00.cbl or similar) to accept, store, and process the new transaction type field when reading or writing transaction records.
3. Update the transaction report COBOL program (e.g., RPTPOS00.cbl or similar) to read and display the transaction type in the generated summary report.
4. Ensure backward compatibility for missing transaction type values.

**Analysis Approach:**  
- Parsed the user story and codebase structure.
- Identified business functions, data elements, and COBOL components related to transaction processing and reporting.
- Mapped direct and indirect dependencies using codebase copybooks, programs, and JCL.
- Filtered out unrelated components.
- Ranked impacted components by proximity, complexity, and criticality.
