**Reasoning**:
- `POSUPDT.cbl` is the main program for position updates and will be the integration point for real-time price feeds and P&L recalculation.
- `POSREC.cpy` is the copybook defining position records, which must be updated for new fields (real-time price, timestamp, etc.).
- `AUDPROC.cbl` and `AUDITLOG.cpy` are directly involved in audit logging, which is required for error and stale feed handling.
- `HISTLD00.cbl` is responsible for loading historical data, and will be updated to persist new price history into the VSAM KSDS.
