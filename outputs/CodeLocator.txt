## **Summary**

**User Story:**  
Add `CHANNEL-CODE` Field to Transaction File for Channel Identification in Batch Processing and Reporting  
- **Goal:** Add a `CHANNEL-CODE` field (`PIC X(04)`) to transaction files and all related processing/reporting, including copybooks, file layouts, program logic, test data, LRECL/FD/JCL, and documentation.
- **Total Impacted Components:** 9 (6 COBOL programs, 2 copybooks, 1 JCL set)
- **Complexity Assessment:**  
  High. The change affects core data structures (copybooks), file layouts, and all batch, utility, and reporting programs that read/write transaction records. It also impacts test data, LRECL/FD, and reporting logic, requiring coordinated updates across multiple system layers.

**Reasoning:**  
- All programs and copybooks that define, read, write, or validate transaction records must be updated for the new `CHANNEL-CODE` field.  
- Reporting and batch programs (RPTPOS00, UTLVAL00) are directly impacted as they process transaction files.  
- Test generators and validators (TSTGEN00, TSTVAL00) are directly/indirectly impacted for test data and validation.  
- JCL must be updated for new LRECL.  
- Audit and batch control programs may be indirectly impacted if they reference the transaction structure or require updated documentation.

**Note:**  
- All impacted programs must be regression tested, and test data must include the new field.  
- Documentation and data dictionary updates are required but not listed as code components.  
- Actual file and paragraph names may vary; this analysis is based on dependency mapping and typical COBOL naming conventions in the provided repository.
