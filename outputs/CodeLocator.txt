**Reasoning**:
- `PORTUPDT.cbl` is the main entry for portfolio updates and will be the integration point for real-time price ingestion, value recalculation, and update logic.
- `PORTFLIO.cpy` is the shared copybook for portfolio data; it will need to support new fields (e.g., last price, timestamp, historical prices).
- `RPTAUD00.cbl` is the batch audit/reporting program, responsible for logging errors (e.g., feed failures, outdated prices) and update events.
- `AUDITLOG.cpy` is the copybook for audit log records, which must be extended to capture new types of events.

No unrelated files or programs are included. Only high-impact, directly affected components are listed, as per the user story and acceptance criteria.
