## Summary

**User Story:**  
Add `CHANNEL-CODE` Field to Transaction File for Channel Identification in Batch Processing and Reporting  
As a COBOL developer, I want to add a `CHANNEL-CODE` field to the transaction file, so that the source of each transaction (e.g., ATM, Mobile, Branch) can be captured and processed, allowing for improved analytics, auditing, and fraud detection based on transaction channels through batch processing and reporting.

- **Total impacted components:** 8 (programs and copybooks)
- **Change complexity:** High. This change affects core data structures (copybooks), file layouts, batch and reporting programs, and requires updates to file definitions, test data, and reporting logic. The impact is broad and touches both direct and indirect consumers of transaction data.

**Reasoning:**  
- The `TRANSACTION.CPY` and `TRNREC.CPY` copybooks are the core data structures for transaction records. All programs that read/write transaction files or generate reports based on transaction data will be directly impacted.
- `TSTGEN00` is responsible for generating test transaction files and must be updated to include the new field.
- `RPTPOS00` and `UTLVAL00` are batch/reporting and validation programs that process transaction files and must be updated to handle the new field.
- `BCHCTL00` and `RPTAUD00` are batch control and audit reporting programs that may reference or output transaction channel information.
- `POSREC.CPY` is a copybook used in reporting and may need updates if it references transaction structure.

**Note:**  
- All file definitions (FD), LRECL, and JCL referencing transaction files must be updated accordingly.
- Test data and documentation must be updated, but these are not COBOL programs and are not listed above.
- The impact is high due to the centrality of the transaction file in batch and reporting processes.
