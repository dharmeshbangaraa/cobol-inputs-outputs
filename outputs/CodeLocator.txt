**Reasoning**:
- `PORTUPDT.cbl` is the main entry for portfolio updates and will be the focal point for ingesting and applying real-time price feeds, recalculating valuations, and updating records.
- `PORTFLIO.cpy` is the copybook defining portfolio structures, which will require updates to support new price fields, timestamps, and possibly status flags for real-time integration.
- `RPTAUD00.cbl` is responsible for audit reporting and will need to log price update events, errors, and maintain historical records as per the user story.
- `AUDITLOG.cpy` is the copybook for audit log records, which will be extended or heavily used for the new logging and alerting requirements.

No unrelated files or programs are included. Only components with a direct, high-impact relationship to the user story are listed, with precise file paths as found in the repository.
