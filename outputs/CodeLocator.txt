# Impact Analysis Report: Add Transaction Type Field to Batch Processing and Reporting

## Summary

**User Story:**  
Add Transaction Type field to transaction processing and reporting in COBOL portfolio system.

- **Goal:** Record and display the type of each transaction (e.g., BUY, SELL, DIVIDEND) in both processing and reporting programs for compliance and business insights.
- **Scope:** Update transaction record layout in the relevant copybook, batch processing program (e.g., TRNVAL00.cbl), and reporting program (e.g., RPTPOS00.cbl) to handle the new field. Ensure backward compatibility for missing values.
- **Total Impacted Components:** 6 (3 High, 2 Medium, 1 Low)
- **Complexity Assessment:** Medium to High. Changes affect core data structures and primary processing/reporting flows, with ripple effects to JCL and legacy compatibility.

**Reasoning:**
- The new field is added to the central transaction record copybook, which is referenced by both the batch processing and reporting programs.
- Both TRNVAL00.cbl and RPTPOS00.cbl require direct logic changes to handle the new field, including reading, writing, and displaying it.
- JCL scripts for both programs may require updates to accommodate the new field in file definitions and parameters.
- The legacy copybook is impacted for backward compatibility, ensuring older records are handled gracefully.
- All other programs and copybooks not referencing the transaction record are excluded as false positives.
