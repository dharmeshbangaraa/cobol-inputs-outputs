**Notes on Reasoning**:

- **BCHVAL00.cbl** (assumed as the main valuation batch program based on naming and typical COBOL conventions) is the central component for valuation logic and must be modified for real-time price ingestion, recalculation, and update.
- **HISTLD00.cbl** is the historical loader for price data, directly required for the new VSAM KSDS PRICEHIST persistence.
- **AUDITLOG.cpy** and **AUDPROC.cbl** are critical for error and audit logging, as required by the acceptance criteria for stale feeds and alarms.
- **BCHCTL00.cbl** is the batch control program, which orchestrates batch jobs and is indirectly impacted by the new feed and valuation requirements.
- Only components present in the repository and with direct or critical indirect impact are included, strictly following the high-impact filter.
