**Reasoning**:
- `PORTUPDT.cbl` is the main entry for portfolio updates and will be responsible for ingesting and processing real-time price feeds, recalculating valuations, and updating risk metrics.
- `PORTFLIO.cpy` is the shared portfolio data structure, which must be extended to store new price and timestamp fields for real-time updates.
- `RPTAUD00.cbl` is the batch audit report generator, which must log all price feed events, errors, and alert triggers as per the user story's error handling and audit requirements.
- `AUDITLOG.cpy` is the audit log copybook, which must be updated to support new event types and timestamps for compliance and traceability.

No unrelated programs or copybooks are included. Only components with a direct, high-impact relationship to the real-time price feed integration and dynamic portfolio update feature are listed. All file paths are as per the repository structure.
