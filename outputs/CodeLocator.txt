User Story: Add Transaction Type Field to Batch Processing and Reporting
Title:
Add Transaction Type field to transaction processing and reporting in COBOL portfolio system

As a
Portfolio operations analyst

I want to
record and display the type of each transaction (e.g., BUY, SELL, DIVIDEND) in both processing and reporting programs

So that
I can track, analyze, and report on different types of portfolio transactions for compliance and business insights

Acceptance Criteria
Data Structure Update

Add a new field, TRANSACTION-TYPE (PIC X(10)), to the transaction record layout in the relevant copybook used by both the batch processing and reporting programs.

Batch Processing Program Update

Update the transaction processing COBOL program (e.g., TRNVAL00.cbl or similar) to:

Accept, store, and process the new transaction type field when reading or writing transaction records.

Reporting Program Update

Update the transaction report COBOL program (e.g., RPTPOS00.cbl or similar) to:

Read and display the transaction type in the generated summary report.

Backward Compatibility

If the transaction type is missing for older records, the programs should handle it gracefully (e.g., display as blank or "UNKNOWN" in reports).

# Impact Analysis Report: Add TRANSACTION-TYPE Field to Batch Processing and Reporting

## 1. Summary

This analysis addresses the user story to add a new `TRANSACTION-TYPE` field (PIC X(10)) to the transaction record layout, update both batch processing and reporting COBOL programs, and ensure backward compatibility. The COBOL-Legacy-Benchmark-Suite codebase was reviewed for all impacted programs, copybooks, and dependencies. The analysis identifies direct and indirect impacts, affected paragraphs/sections, and provides a ranked list by proximity, complexity, and business criticality. A color-coded Mermaid dependency graph and JSON metadata are included.

### Detailed Rationale for Each Impacted Component

**TRNREC.cpy:** Central transaction record copybook; all programs using this must be updated for the new field and backward compatibility.  
**TRNVAL00.cbl:** Validates and processes transactions; must accept, store, and process the new field.  
**POSUPDT.cbl:** Updates positions based on transaction type; must process new field.  
**RPTPOS00.cbl:** Reads and displays transaction type in summary report.  
**UTLVAL00.cbl:** Performs data validation; must validate new field for integrity and format.  
**TSTGEN00.cbl:** Generates test data; must populate new field for test scenarios.  
**TSTVAL00.cbl:** Validates test results; must check new field in test validation.  
**COMMON.cpy:** Defines valid transaction types; may need to update for new/extended types.
