**Reasoning**:
- `PORTUPDT.cbl` is the main entry for portfolio updates and will be directly responsible for applying real-time price changes and recalculating values.
- `RCVPRC00.cbl` is the batch receiver for price data, which must be adapted for real-time polling and error handling as per the user story.
- `PORTFLIO.cpy` is the shared copybook for portfolio data; it will need to be extended for timestamping and historical price storage.
- `RPTAUD00.cbl` is the audit report generator, which must be updated to log errors, outdated prices, and maintain a historical record as required by the acceptance criteria.
