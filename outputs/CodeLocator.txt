I am unable to directly access or parse content from external URLs or GitHub repositories. To proceed with the comprehensive impact analysis as specified, I require the actual content of the user story and the relevant COBOL codebase or dependency maps. Please provide the user story text and any relevant COBOL program lists or dependency information. Once you provide these, I will analyze them and generate the structured markdown report with ranked impact list, JSON metadata, and dependency visualization as required.
