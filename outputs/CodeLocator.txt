Reasoning:
- **POSVAL00.cbl** is the main batch program for position valuation, directly impacted by the need to consume real-time price feeds, recalculate P&L, and update timestamps.
- **AUDPROC.cbl** and **AUDITLOG.cpy** are required for error handling and audit logging when the feed fails or prices are stale, per acceptance criteria.
- **POSREC.cpy** must be updated to store new valuation fields and timestamps.
- **HISTLD00.cbl** is responsible for persisting historical price feeds into the new VSAM KSDS, enabling backtesting and fulfilling the requirement for historical data storage.
- All components are present in the repository and are directly related to the user story's business logic and data flow.

**No extra files have been added; all paths are verified against the repository.**
