**Reasoning**:
- `PORTUPDT.cbl` is the main entry for portfolio updates and will be the focal point for integrating real-time price feeds, recalculating values, and updating positions.
- `PORTFLIO.cpy` is the shared copybook for portfolio data; it must be extended to store new price/timestamp fields and is used by both update and reporting programs.
- `RPTAUD00.cbl` is responsible for audit and reporting; it must be enhanced to log feed failures, outdated prices, and maintain a historical record of price updates.
- `AUDITLOG.cpy` is the shared audit log structure; it must support new event types for integration errors and price update events.

No unrelated programs or copybooks are included. All listed components are present in the repository and are directly impacted by the user story requirements. No new files are created or assumed.
