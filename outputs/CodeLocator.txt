**Notes on Reasoning**:
- Only files present in the repository are included.
- All identified components are directly involved in real-time price ingestion, valuation, audit/error handling, or historical price storage.
- No unrelated or medium/low impact files are included.
- All file paths are as per the repository structure.
- No new files are created; all logic must be added to existing files.
