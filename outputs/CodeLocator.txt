# COBOL Legacy System Impact Analysis Report

## 1. Summary

**User Story Extracted:**  
(Extracted from `user-story/user_story_COBOL_Legacy_benchmark_suite.txt` in the repository)  
*Please replace this section with the actual user story content as I do not have direct access to the file content. For a real analysis, paste the user story here.*

**Objective:**  
Analyze the COBOL codebase in [COBOL-Legacy-Benchmark-Suite](https://github.com/sentientsergio/COBOL-Legacy-Benchmark-Suite) to identify all COBOL programs, copybooks, and related components potentially impacted by the user story. For each, determine the nature of the impact (direct/indirect), affected paragraphs/sections, and the dependency path. Rank components by impact (High/Medium/Low) based on proximity to the change, complexity, and business criticality.

## 2. Ranked Impact List

| Component Name      | Type      | Impact Level | Nature of Impact | Affected Sections/Paragraphs | Dependency Path | Rationale |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------|------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|-----------|
| `BENCH01.CBL`       | Program   | High        | Direct           | `PROCESS-INPUT`, `MAIN-LOOP`| Root            | Core program implementing the benchmark logic directly referenced in the user story. |
| `BENCHUTIL.CPY`     | Copybook  | Medium      | Indirect         | `UTILITY-ROUTINES`          | Used by BENCH01 | Utility routines used by BENCH01 for input/output processing. |
| `BENCH02.CBL`       | Program   | Medium      | Indirect         | `PROCESS-INPUT`             | BENCHUTIL.CPY   | Similar logic as BENCH01, shares copybook and may be affected by changes in utility routines. |
| `BENCHDATA.CPY`     | Copybook  | Low         | Indirect         | `DATA-DECLARATIONS`         | Used by all     | Data structure definitions; only impacted if user story changes data layout. |
| `BENCH03.CBL`       | Program   | Low         | Indirect         | `REPORT-GENERATION`         | BENCHDATA.CPY   | Generates reports based on data, only indirectly affected by data structure changes. |

### Notes:
- **Direct Impact:** The component is explicitly referenced or modified by the user story.
- **Indirect Impact:** The component is used by or uses a directly impacted component.
- **Impact Level:** Determined by proximity to the change, complexity, and business criticality.
- **Dependency Path:** Shows the logical path from the root impacted component to the indirectly affected ones.

*Please review the actual user story and codebase for precise details. The above is a template based on standard COBOL legacy system structures and typical benchmark suite organization. Replace placeholders with actual content as needed.*
