# Impact Analysis Report: Add Transaction Type Field to Batch Processing and Reporting

---

## **Summary**

**User Story:**  
Add Transaction Type field to transaction processing and reporting in COBOL portfolio system

**Overview:**  
A new field, `TRANSACTION-TYPE (PIC X(10))`, must be added to the transaction record layout (copybook) and supported throughout all batch processing and reporting programs that read, write, or display transaction records. The change must be backward compatible for legacy records.

**Total impacted components:** 6  
**Change complexity:** High â€“ impacts core data structures, batch processing, reporting, and requires validation for backward compatibility.

## **Reasoning**

- **TRNREC.cpy** is the central copybook for transaction records; any structural change here ripples to all programs that include it.
- **PORTTRAN.cbl** and **RPTPOS00.cbl** are the primary batch and reporting programs, directly reading/writing/displaying transaction records.
- **POSUPDT.cbl** and **HISTLD00.cbl** process transactions for position and history updates; they must be updated for the new field.
- **RPTAUD00.cbl** may indirectly be impacted if it references transaction records.
- All identified programs must handle the new field and ensure backward compatibility for legacy records.
