**Summary**:
Unable to generate the impact analysis report at this time. The required user story details ({{user_story_details}}) and the COBOL-Legacy-Benchmark-Suite-main folder contents are not accessible due to encoding issues encountered during file extraction from the 'inputs' folder in the 'dharmeshbangaraa/cobol-inputs-outputs' GitHub repository. Both inputs are essential for identifying and ranking impacted COBOL components as per the instructions.

**Ranked Impact List**:
No analysis performed. Impacted components cannot be identified without access to the user story and codebase.

**JSON Metadata**:
```json
{
  "impactAnalysis": {
    "userStory": null,
    "impactedComponents": [],
    "error": "Required files and user story details are not accessible due to encoding issues. Please provide files in a compatible encoding and supply the user story details."
  }
}
```

**Visualization**:
No dependency graph generated due to lack of input data.

**Next Steps**:
- Please provide the user story details.
- Ensure the COBOL-Legacy-Benchmark-Suite-main folder files are supplied in a compatible encoding (e.g., UTF-8).
- Once these inputs are available, a comprehensive impact analysis report can be generated as instructed.
