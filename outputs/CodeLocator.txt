**Summary**:

User Story: Integrate real-time market price feed for dynamic portfolio valuation  
- 5 impacted components identified (**High impact only**)  
- High complexity change: introduces real-time data ingestion, dynamic recalculation, error/audit handling, new VSAM for price history, and performance requirements. Impacts core valuation, position, and audit logic, as well as copybooks and JCL for batch and online processing.

**Notes on Reasoning**:
- Only files present in the codebase and directly tied to the user story's requirements are included.
- RPTPOS00.cbl is the main reporting/valuation batch program; it must be enhanced for real-time price updates and recalculation logic.
- POSREC.cpy is the shared copybook for position records and is central to value/P&L changes.
- AUDPROC.cbl and AUDITLOG.cpy handle audit/error logging, which must be extended for new alarm and audit requirements.
- HISTLD00.cbl is responsible for loading historical price data into VSAM, aligning with the new PRICEHIST requirement.
- All components are ranked as "High" due to their central role in the new real-time valuation, audit, and historical data features.

**No extra files are included. Only existing repository files are analyzed and listed.**
