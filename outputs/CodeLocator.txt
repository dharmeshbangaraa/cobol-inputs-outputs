**Summary**:
User Story: Add `CHANNEL-CODE` Field to Transaction File for Channel Identification in Batch Processing and Reporting  
- 5 impacted components identified (**High impact only**)  
- High complexity change: impacts core transaction copybook, all batch/utility/reporting programs that read/write transaction data, and JCL referencing LRECL/FD for transaction files.

**Reasoning**:
- `TRNREC.cpy` is the canonical transaction record definition. All programs that process transaction data include this copybook. Adding `CHANNEL-CODE` here is a direct, high-impact change.
- `RPTPOS00.cbl` (batch reporting), `UTLVAL00.cbl` (utility validation), `TSTGEN00.cbl` (test data generation), and `TSTVAL00.cbl` (test validation) all directly read/write transaction files and depend on the transaction record structure. Each must be updated for the new field, including FD/LRECL, file I/O, and reporting logic.
- Only these components are included as **High impact** because they are directly responsible for reading/writing transaction data or generating/validating test data for transactions. Other programs/copybooks/JCL are not directly impacted unless they reference the transaction record or files, which is not indicated in the dependency map for this user story.
