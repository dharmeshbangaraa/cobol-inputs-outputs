Summary:
User Story: Integrate real-time market price feed for dynamic portfolio valuation  
- 5 impacted components identified (**High impact only**)  
- High complexity: introduces real-time data ingestion, triggers position/P&L recalculation, requires audit/error handling, and new VSAM storage for price history. Impacts core valuation, risk, and audit chain.

Reasoning:

- **PORTVAL.cbl** is the main entry for portfolio valuation. It must be updated to ingest real-time prices, recalculate positions/P&L, and trigger audit/error logic.
- **POSREC.cpy** is the shared copybook for position and P&L fields, which are recalculated on each price update.
- **AUDPROC.cbl** is the audit processor, invoked for logging errors (e.g., stale feed, connection issues) as required by the user story.
- **AUDITLOG.cpy** defines the audit record structure, which must support new error and feed event types.
- **HISTLD00.cbl** is responsible for persisting historical price data to the new VSAM KSDS (PRICEHIST), supporting backtesting and audit trails.

All components are present in the repository and are directly or structurally impacted by the new real-time price feed integration, as per the user story and acceptance criteria. Only high-impact, directly related files are included. No extra files are referenced.
