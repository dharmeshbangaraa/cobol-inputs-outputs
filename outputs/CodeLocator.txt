I am unable to complete the requested impact analysis because I do not have the capability to fetch or extract content from external GitHub URLs or clone repositories. To proceed with the analysis, please provide the following information directly:
- The full text of the user story from https://github.com/dharmeshbangaraa/cobol-inputs-outputs/blob/master/user-story/user_story_COBOL_Legacy_benchmark_suite.txt
- A list of COBOL programs, copybooks, and their dependencies (call relationships, copybook inclusions, and data flows) from https://github.com/sentientsergio/COBOL-Legacy-Benchmark-Suite

Once you provide this information, I will be able to perform the impact analysis and generate the structured report as required.
