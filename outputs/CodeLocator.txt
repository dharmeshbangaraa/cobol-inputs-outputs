## Summary

**User Story:**  
Add `CHANNEL-CODE` Field to Transaction File for Channel Identification in Batch Processing and Reporting  
As a COBOL developer, I want to add a `CHANNEL-CODE` field to the transaction file, so that the source of each transaction (e.g., ATM, Mobile, Branch) can be captured and processed, allowing for improved analytics, auditing, and fraud detection based on transaction channels through batch processing and reporting.

- **Total impacted components:** 9 (COBOL programs and copybooks)
- **High-level assessment:**  
  This is a high-complexity change. It affects the core transaction data structure, file layouts, all programs that read/write transaction files, reporting, and test data. It requires coordinated updates to copybooks, file definitions (FD/LRECL), batch and reporting programs, and test utilities.

**Reasoning:**  
- The core change is to the transaction record structure, which is defined in `TRANSACTION.CPY` and/or `TRNREC.CPY`.  
- All batch, reporting, and utility programs that read/write transaction files or use these copybooks are directly impacted.  
- Test data generation and validation utilities must be updated to handle the new field.  
- JCL scripts must be updated for new LRECL/FD.  
- Indirectly, copybooks like `POSREC.CPY` may be affected if they reference or format transaction data for reports or validation.

**Note:**  
- Actual program/copybook names may vary slightly; mapping is based on the dependency analysis and typical naming conventions in the provided codebase.
- All identified programs and copybooks must be reviewed and tested for correct handling of the new `CHANNEL-CODE` field.  
- Documentation and data dictionary updates are also required but are not included in the code impact list.
