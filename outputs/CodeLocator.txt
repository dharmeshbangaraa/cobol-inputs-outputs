**Summary**:
User Story: Integrate real-time market price feed for dynamic portfolio valuation  
- 6 impacted components identified (**High impact only**)  
- High complexity: Involves real-time data ingestion, DB2 updates, batch recalculation, CICS screen refresh, audit logging, and new VSAM file integration. Touches multiple core business processes and technical layers (DB2, batch, CICS, VSAM, audit).
