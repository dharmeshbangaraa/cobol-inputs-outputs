**Reasoning**:

- **POSUPDT.cbl** is the main entry for position updates and will be the focal point for integrating real-time price ingestion, recalculation, and error handling.
- **POSREC.cpy** is the shared copybook for position records, which must be enhanced to support new fields (e.g., last update timestamp, historical prices).
- **AUDPROC.cbl** is responsible for audit logging and must be invoked for every update and error, as per the new requirements.
- **AUDITLOG.cpy** is the copybook for audit log records, which must be extended to log new event types (price update, feed error, etc.).

No unrelated programs or copybooks are included. Only components with direct, high-impact logical connections to the user story are listed. No new files are created; all changes are scoped to existing repository files.
