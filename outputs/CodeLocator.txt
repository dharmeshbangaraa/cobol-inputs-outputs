**Notes on Reasoning**:
- Only existing files in the repository are included.
- POSUPDT.cbl is the logical entry point for position updates and will require the most significant changes for real-time integration.
- POSREC.cpy is a shared copybook for position records, which must be extended for new data fields.
- AUDPROC.cbl and AUDITLOG.cpy are central to error handling and audit logging, both of which are critical per the user story.
- HISTLD00.cbl is responsible for maintaining historical price records, directly supporting the requirement for historical analysis.
- All other programs, copybooks, and JCL files were reviewed and excluded if not directly or critically impacted by the real-time feed integration, valuation, or logging requirements.
