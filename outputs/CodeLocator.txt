**Reasoning**:

- `src/programs/portfolio/PORTUPDT.cbl` is the main entry for portfolio updates and will be the focal point for integrating real-time price feeds, recalculating valuations, and updating P/L metrics.
- `src/copybook/common/PORTFLIO.cpy` is the shared copybook defining the portfolio record structure. It will require changes to support new fields for real-time prices, timestamps, and possibly historical price arrays.
- `src/programs/batch/RPTAUD00.cbl` is responsible for audit logging and historical reporting, both of which are critical for tracking price update events, error conditions, and supporting new reporting requirements as per the user story.

No unrelated files or programs are included. Only high-impact, directly relevant components are listed, with full file paths as present in the repository.
