**Reasoning**:
- `PORTUPDT.cbl` is the main portfolio update program and must be extended to process real-time price updates and recalculate valuations.
- `RCVPRC00.cbl` is a batch receiver program, suitable for implementing the polling and ingestion of external market data, as well as error handling and alerting.
- `AUDITLOG.cpy` is the shared copybook for audit logging, which will be used to record all price updates, errors, and maintain historical records.
- `RPTAUD00.cbl` generates audit reports and will be impacted as it must now include new types of audit records related to real-time price updates and errors.
