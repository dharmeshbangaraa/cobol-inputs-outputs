User Story: Integrate real-time market price feed for dynamic portfolio valuation  
- 6 impacted components identified (**High impact only**)  
- High complexity: Touches real-time data ingestion, position/P&L recalculation, audit/error handling, VSAM history persistence, and performance scaling. Changes affect both online and batch processing, as well as shared copybooks.

**Notes on Reasoning**:
- Only files present in the codebase are included.
- RPTPOS00.cbl is the main entry for position/P&L reporting and recalculation.
- HISTLD00.cbl is responsible for historical price feed persistence.
- POSREC.cpy and AUDITLOG.cpy are shared copybooks for position and audit data, respectively.
- AUDPROC.cbl processes audit logs and triggers alarms.
- RTNCDE00.cbl handles return codes and alarms for error conditions.
- All are directly or indirectly required to fulfill the user story and acceptance criteria for real-time updates, error handling, and audit/history.
