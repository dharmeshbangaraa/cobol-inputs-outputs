**Summary**:
User Story: As a COBOL application maintainer, I want a benchmark suite of legacy COBOL programs, so that I can evaluate the correctness and performance of COBOL compilers and runtime environments.

- 7 impacted components identified (all core programs, copybooks, and JCLs referenced in the suite and its dependency map)
- High complexity: The change affects the structure and documentation of all benchmark programs, their dependencies, and the overall dependency mapping/documentation process.

**Reasoning**:
- The user story requires that every benchmark program, copybook, and JCL be documented, mapped, and supplied with input/output files.
- All core programs and their direct dependencies are impacted at a high level, as their structure, documentation, and mapping are central to the acceptance criteria.
- Shared copybooks and JCLs are impacted at a medium level, as they must be included in the dependency mapping and documentation but are not the primary focus of the business logic.
- The dependency map and documentation files themselves are also impacted, but as supporting artifacts rather than COBOL code, they are not listed in the main table.

This comprehensive report identifies and ranks all COBOL components impacted by the user story, with detailed JSON metadata and a visual dependency graph as required.
