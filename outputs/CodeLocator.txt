**Summary**:
User Story: COBOL Legacy Benchmark Suite  
As a mainframe modernization engineer, I want a benchmark suite of COBOL programs with realistic business logic, data structures, and I/O patterns, so that I can evaluate the correctness and performance of COBOL-to-cloud migration tools and platforms.

Key business functions:  
- Batch processing of customer accounts  
- Calculation of interest and fees  
- Generation of monthly statements  
- Update of account balances  
- Reporting of summary statistics

Total number of impacted components: 5  
High-level assessment of change complexity:  
The change impacts the entire business process chain, involving batch processing, calculations, statement generation, account updates, and reporting. All major programs and their dependencies are involved, with high interconnectivity and shared data structures.

**Ranked Impact List**:

| Program      | Impact | Nature  | Affected Paragraphs/Sections | Dependency Path           |
|--------------|--------|---------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| MAINBATCH    | High   | Direct  | PROCESS-ACCOUNTS, CALC-INTEREST, GEN-STATEMENTS, UPDATE-MASTER | MAINBATCH                |
| CALCFEES     | High   | Direct  | CALC-FEES, APPLY-FEES        | MAINBATCH → CALCFEES     |
| STATGEN      | High   | Direct  | GEN-STATEMENT, WRITE-STATEMENT| MAINBATCH → STATGEN      |
| UPDATEMSTR   | Medium | Indirect| UPDATE-RECORD, WRITE-MASTER  | MAINBATCH → UPDATEMSTR   |
| REPTGEN      | Medium | Indirect| GEN-REPORT, SUMMARIZE        | MAINBATCH → REPTGEN      |

**Reasoning**:  
- All identified programs are directly or indirectly involved in the business functions described in the user story.
- MAINBATCH is the entry point and orchestrates all major processes.
- CALCFEES and STATGEN are directly called for fee calculation and statement generation.
- UPDATEMSTR and REPTGEN are called for updating master records and generating reports, respectively.
- Impact scores are assigned based on proximity to the core change, complexity, and business criticality.
- All affected paragraphs/sections are directly tied to the user story's business processes and data elements.
