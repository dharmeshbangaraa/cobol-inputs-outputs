**Summary**:
Unable to complete the impact analysis as requested. The user story details were successfully extracted from the provided User Story GitHub URL (https://github.com/dharmeshbangaraa/cobol-inputs-outputs/blob/master/user-story/user_story_COBOL_Legacy_benchmark_suite.txt). However, access to the COBOL codebase repository (https://github.com/sentientsergio/COBOL-Legacy-Benchmark-Suite) failed due to repeated 404 errors, making it impossible to analyze the codebase, map dependencies, or generate the required report.

- 0 impacted components identified
- Unable to assess change complexity due to lack of codebase access

**Ranked Impact List**:

| Program | Impact | Nature | Affected Paragraphs | Dependency Path |
|---------|--------|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| _No data available due to codebase access failure_ |

**JSON Metadata**:

  "impactAnalysis": {
    "userStory": "user_story_COBOL_Legacy_benchmark_suite.txt",
    "impactedComponents": [],
    "error": "Unable to access codebase at https://github.com/sentientsergio/COBOL-Legacy-Benchmark-Suite due to 404 errors. No analysis performed."
  }
}
```

**Visualization**:
_No dependency graph generated due to codebase access failure._

**Reasoning**:
- The user story was accessible and parsed.
- The COBOL codebase repository could not be accessed (404 errors), so no program, paragraph, or control path analysis could be performed.
- Please verify the repository URL, its visibility, or provide the correct folder path to enable a complete impact analysis.
