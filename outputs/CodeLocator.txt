**Reasoning**:
- **PORTVAL.cbl** is the valuation engine, central to recalculating positions and P&L on price updates.
- **POSUPDT.cbl** is invoked by PORTVAL for updating position records.
- **PRICEDATA.cbl** is responsible for ingesting external price ticks into DB2, as required for real-time updates.
- **PORTDISP.cbl** is the CICS online display, which must refresh with new valuations.
- **AUDPROC.cbl** and **AUDITLOG.cpy** are critical for error handling and audit logging, as required for stale feed detection and compliance.
- **HISTLD00.cbl** handles the loading of historical price data into the new VSAM KSDS for backtesting, as per acceptance criteria.

All components listed are directly and critically involved in the new real-time valuation and audit feature, and thus are classified as **High impact**. No unrelated or medium/low impact files are included. Paths are verified against the repository structure.
