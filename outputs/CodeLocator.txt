**Notes**:
- Only files present in the repository and directly related to the real-time pricing, valuation, audit, and historical persistence are included.
- JCL files are not included as high impact since the main logic and data changes are within the COBOL and copybook layers for this user story.
- All identified components are critical to the real-time valuation and audit trail as per the user story and acceptance criteria.
