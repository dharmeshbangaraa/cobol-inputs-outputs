# Impact Analysis Report: Add Transaction Type Field to Batch Processing and Reporting

## 1. Summary

**User Story:**  
As a Portfolio operations analyst, I want to record and display the type of each transaction (e.g., BUY, SELL, DIVIDEND) in both processing and reporting programs, so that I can track, analyze, and report on different types of portfolio transactions for compliance and business insights.

**Total impacted components:** 8  
**High-level assessment:**  
This is a high-complexity change. It requires updates to core data structures (copybooks), batch processing and reporting COBOL programs, and associated JCLs. The change propagates through direct and indirect dependencies due to the shared transaction record layout.

**Reasoning:**  
- The core transaction record copybooks are the highest-impact components, as all downstream programs depend on their structure.
- Batch and reporting COBOL programs are directly impacted due to their use of the transaction record and their business-critical roles.
- Loader and updater programs are medium impact, as they process the transaction record but may not be directly involved in reporting or validation.
- Associated JCLs are medium impact, as file layouts may need to be updated for the new field.
- All identified components are logically connected to the user story and are necessary to fulfill the acceptance criteria.
