# Impact Analysis Report: Add Transaction Type Field to Batch Processing and Reporting

---

## Summary

**User Story:**  
Add Transaction Type field to transaction processing and reporting in COBOL portfolio system

- **Goal:** Record and display the type of each transaction (e.g., BUY, SELL, DIVIDEND) in both processing and reporting programs for compliance and business insights.
- **Scope:** Update transaction record layout (copybook), batch processing, and reporting programs. Ensure backward compatibility.
- **Total Impacted Components:** 6 primary COBOL programs/copybooks (plus indirect batch control).
- **Complexity:** Medium-High. Affects core data structure, multiple programs, and requires backward compatibility logic.

**Reasoning:**  
- **TRNREC.cpy** is the central copybook for transaction records and must be updated to add the new field.
- **PORTTRAN.cbl** and **RPTPOS00.cbl** are the main batch processing and reporting programs, directly handling the transaction type.
- **UTLVAL00.cbl**, **TSTGEN00.cbl**, and **TSTVAL00.cbl** are support/test programs that use the transaction record and must be updated for validation and test coverage.
- Impact levels are based on proximity to the data structure, business criticality, and the likelihood of requiring code changes.
- All identified programs use the transaction record copybook directly and are logically connected to the user story's requirements.
