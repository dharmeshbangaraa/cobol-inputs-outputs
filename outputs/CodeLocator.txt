**Summary**:

User Story: Integrate real-time market price feed for dynamic portfolio valuation  
- 4 impacted components identified (**High impact only**)  
- High complexity: Real-time data ingestion, position valuation recalculation, audit/error handling, and historical price persistence require significant changes across core portfolio processing, audit logging, and VSAM/database management components.

**Reasoning**:

- `POSUPDT.cbl` is the central batch program for position updates, and will be the main integration point for real-time price ingestion, recalculation, and persistence.
- `POSREC.cpy` defines the structure of position records, which must be extended for new valuation and timestamp fields.
- `AUDITLOG.cpy` is the copybook for audit logging, which will be directly impacted by new requirements for error and feed event logging.
- `AUDPROC.cbl` is the common audit processor, which will be invoked for new error and audit scenarios and must be updated to handle these.
