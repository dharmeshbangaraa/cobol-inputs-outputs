**Key Reasoning**:
- `PORTUPDT.cbl` is the main entry for portfolio updates and will be the primary consumer of real-time price feeds, requiring significant changes for ingestion, recalculation, and error handling.
- `PORTTRAN.cbl` processes transactions that depend on up-to-date prices, so it must be tightly integrated with the new feed and error logic.
- `AUDITLOG.cpy` is the central copybook for audit logging, and will be extended to support new error and event types for the feed.
- `RPTAUD00.cbl` generates audit reports and must be updated to reflect new audit log entries related to the real-time feed.

No other files in the repository have a direct or high-impact logical connection to the user story requirements. All identified components are present in the codebase and are critical to the new feature.
