Reasoning:
- `PORTUPDT.cbl` is the main entry for portfolio updates and will be the integration point for real-time price feeds, requiring significant changes to initialization, processing, and update logic.
- `PORTFLIO.cpy` is the shared copybook for portfolio data; it will need to accommodate new fields for real-time prices, timestamps, and possibly historical data.
- `AUDITLOG.cpy` is the shared audit log structure, essential for logging feed errors, stale data, and update events as required by the user story.
- `RPTAUD00.cbl` is the batch reporting program that consumes the audit log and will reflect new types of audit entries generated by the real-time integration.
