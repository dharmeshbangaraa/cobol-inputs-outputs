**Reasoning**:

- **PORTVAL.cbl** is the main entry for portfolio valuation and must be updated to ingest real-time prices and trigger recalculation.
- **POSVAL.cbl** is called by PORTVAL to recalculate position values and P&L, directly impacted by the new price feed.
- **AUDPROC.cbl** and **AUDITLOG.cpy** are responsible for audit logging, which must be enhanced for new error and staleness conditions.
- **HISTLD00.cbl** is responsible for loading and persisting historical price feeds into the new VSAM KSDS (PRICEHIST), as required for backtesting and audit.
- All components are present in the repository and are directly related to the user story's requirements for real-time ingestion, recalculation, error handling, audit, and historical data management.

**Note:** No extra files are included; only existing, high-impact files from the codebase are listed. All paths are as per the repository structure.
