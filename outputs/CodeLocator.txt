The Developer Assistant Agent is unable to access or retrieve the actual content of the user story file or enumerate the COBOL codebase components directly from the provided GitHub URLs. To proceed with the comprehensive impact analysis as instructed, please provide:

- The full content of the user story file (`user_story_COBOL_Legacy_benchmark_suite.txt`)
- A list of all COBOL programs, copybooks, and related components (with file paths if possible) from the codebase repository

Once this information is available, I can generate the required structured report, including the summary, ranked impact list, JSON metadata, and mermaid dependency graph as specified in your instructions.
