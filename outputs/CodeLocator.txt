**Notes on Reasoning**:
- Only files present in the repository are included.
- All components are directly tied to the user story’s acceptance criteria: ingestion, valuation, display, error/audit, and performance.
- Impact scores are based on direct involvement in the new real-time feed, portfolio valuation, and audit requirements.
- No unrelated or medium/low impact files are included.
- JCL files are not listed as high impact for this user story, as the main changes are in COBOL programs and copybooks directly handling the new feed and valuation logic.
