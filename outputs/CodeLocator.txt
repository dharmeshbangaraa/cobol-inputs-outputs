**Reasoning**:
- `PORTUPDT.cbl` is the main entry for portfolio updates and will be the integration point for real-time price feeds, triggering downstream recalculations.
- `UTLVAL00.cbl` is responsible for valuation and risk metric updates, which must be recalculated on every price update.
- `AUDITLOG.cpy` is used for logging and alerting, as required by error handling and stale price detection.
- `POSREC.cpy` defines the position and price history records, which must be updated to store each received price for historical analysis.
