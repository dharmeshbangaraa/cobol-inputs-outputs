**Summary**:
User Story: Integrate real-time market price feed for dynamic portfolio valuation  
- 5 impacted components identified (**High impact only**)  
- High complexity change: introduces real-time data ingestion, dynamic recalculation, error/audit logging, new VSAM file for historical prices, and performance/scalability requirements. Impacts core valuation, audit, and data persistence logic.

**Key Notes:**
- Only existing files in the repository are included.
- All components listed are essential for real-time price ingestion, valuation, audit/error handling, and historical data persistence.
- No extraneous files or low/medium impact components are included.
- File paths are exact and match the repository structure.
- All required business logic for the user story must be implemented in these files only.
