**Reasoning**:
- `PORTUPDT.cbl` is the main entry for portfolio updates and will be the focal point for integrating real-time price feeds and recalculating valuations.
- `RCVPRC00.cbl` is responsible for batch price ingestion and recovery, and will need to be adapted for real-time polling and error handling.
- `PORTFLIO.cpy` is the shared copybook for portfolio records, which must be extended to store historical prices and timestamps.
- `AUDITLOG.cpy` is the copybook for audit logging, which must record all price feed events, errors, and alerts.
- `RPTAUD00.cbl` generates audit reports and will need to process the new types of audit entries.
