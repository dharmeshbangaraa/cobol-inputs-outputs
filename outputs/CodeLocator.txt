## Summary

**User Story:**  
Enable Real-Time Market Price Feed Integration for Dynamic Portfolio Updates

**Overview:**  
The system must ingest real-time market prices, update portfolio valuations and risk metrics, handle errors and log events, and maintain a historical record of prices. This impacts the data ingestion, valuation update, error handling, logging, and historical price recording processes.

**Total High-Impact Components Identified:** 5  
**Change Complexity:** High. The change affects core data flows, error handling, and audit logging across multiple programs and copybooks.

**Reasoning:**  
- Only components with direct, high-impact relationships to the user story are included.
- File paths are taken exactly as present in the repository.
- No unrelated or non-existent files are listed.
- Each component is critical for either data ingestion, valuation update, error handling, or audit logging as required by the user story.
