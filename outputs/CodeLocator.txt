I am unable to access external GitHub URLs directly. To proceed with the comprehensive COBOL impact analysis as requested, please provide:
- The full content of the user story file (`user_story_COBOL_Legacy_benchmark_suite.txt`)
- The COBOL source files and copybooks from the `COBOL-Legacy-Benchmark-Suite` repository (or at least a list of their filenames and main program/copybook names)

Once these are provided, I will:
1. Parse the user story for business functions, data elements, and COBOL-specific references.
2. Analyze the COBOL codebase for program/copybook structure and dependencies.
3. Map and rank the impacted components as per your detailed instructions, providing the structured markdown report, JSON metadata, and mermaid dependency graph as required.
