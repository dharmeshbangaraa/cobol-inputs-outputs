**Legend:**  
- All nodes and edges represent **High impact** only.  
- Arrows indicate direct dependency on copybooks or file layouts that must be updated for `CHANNEL-CODE`.

---

**Reasoning**:
- The addition of `CHANNEL-CODE` to the transaction file requires changes to the transaction record copybook (`TRNREC.cpy`), which is included in all programs that process transaction data.
- All batch, utility, and reporting programs that read/write transaction files must update their FD sections, file layouts, and logic to handle the new field.
- Test data generation and validation utilities must be updated to generate, validate, and process the new field.
- Reporting programs must include the new field in outputs.
- Copybooks like `POSREC.cpy` are also impacted if they define or reference transaction file layouts.
- Only files present in the repository and directly impacted by the user story are included, as per instructions. No extra files are added.
