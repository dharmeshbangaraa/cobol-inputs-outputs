**Reasoning**:

- **RPTPOS00.cbl** is the main batch reporting program that calculates and outputs portfolio P&L, directly affected by the rounding requirement.
- **POSREC.cpy** is the core copybook defining P&L fields, ensuring correct data type and decimal enforcement for all programs using it.
- **TSTVAL00.cbl** is the regression test program that must validate the new rounding logic per acceptance criteria.

No other components in the repository have a direct or critical impact on P&L rounding as per the dependency map and user story scope. All identified files are present in the repository and are essential for the change.
