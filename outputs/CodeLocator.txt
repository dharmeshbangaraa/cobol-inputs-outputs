To perform the requested impact analysis, I need the following:
1. The full content of the user story file from https://github.com/dharmeshbangaraa/cobol-inputs-outputs/blob/master/user-story/user_story_COBOL_Legacy_benchmark_suite.txt.
2. A listing of the COBOL codebase from https://github.com/sentientsergio/COBOL-Legacy-Benchmark-Suite, including the names and (if possible) contents of COBOL programs, copybooks, and data structure files.

Once this information is provided, I will:
- Parse and summarize the user story.
- Identify and map relevant COBOL components and dependencies.
- Rank the impact and prepare the required markdown report with all requested details.

Please provide the above information to continue.
