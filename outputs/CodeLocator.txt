**Summary**:

User Story: Enable Real-Time Market Price Feed Integration for Dynamic Portfolio Updates

- The system must ingest real-time market prices, update portfolio valuations and risk metrics, handle errors and logging, and maintain historical price records.
- **5 high-impact components** identified (COBOL programs and copybooks).
- High complexity: Touches core data ingestion, valuation, error handling, and audit logging paths, requiring changes to both business logic and supporting data structures.

**Reasoning**:

- **PORTUPDT.cbl** is the main entry for portfolio updates and will be the integration point for real-time price ingestion, valuation, and risk updates.
- **AUDPROC.cbl** and **AUDITLOG.cpy** are central to error handling and audit logging, both required by the user story for compliance and alerting.
- **HISTLD00.cbl** is responsible for historical price record maintenance, which is explicitly required for analysis and reporting.
- **POSREC.cpy** is the core data structure for positions, which will be directly impacted by the need to store and update real-time price information.

**No other components in the repository have a direct, high-impact relationship to the user story requirements.** All identified components are present in the codebase and are strictly required for the feature.
