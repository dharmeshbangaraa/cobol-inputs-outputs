**Reasoning**:

- `POSVAL00.cbl` is the central program for position valuation and will be the main entry point for integrating the real-time price feed, recalculating P&L, and storing results.
- `POSREC.cpy` is the shared copybook for position and P&L data, which will need to be extended for new fields (real-time price, timestamp, etc.) and is used by all valuation/reporting modules.
- `AUDPROC.cbl` and `AUDITLOG.cpy` are responsible for audit/error logging, which must be invoked for feed failures or stale data as per the acceptance criteria.
- `HISTLD00.cbl` is responsible for loading and persisting historical price feeds into the new VSAM KSDS PRICEHIST, enabling backtesting and audit trails.

**Note:** All components listed are present in the repository and are strictly filtered for HIGH impact only, as per instructions. No extra or non-existent files are included.
