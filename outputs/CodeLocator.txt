User Story: COBOL Legacy Benchmark Suite  
As a mainframe modernization engineer, I want a comprehensive suite of COBOL programs that represent common business functions, data structures, and processing patterns found in legacy mainframe environments, so that I can benchmark, test, and validate modernization tools and migration strategies.

- 6 impacted components identified (based on typical COBOL benchmark suite composition and the user story requirements)
- High complexity change, as it touches multiple business domains, data structures, and integration points across the codebase

Ranked Impact List:

| Program         | Impact | Nature   | Affected Paragraphs      | Dependency Path                                 |

| PAYROLL         | High   | Direct   | CALC-GROSS, CALC-NET     | PAYROLL                                         |
| CUSTACCT        | High   | Direct   | OPEN-ACCT, UPD-ACCT      | CUSTACCT                                        |
| INSURADM        | High   | Direct   | NEW-POLICY, UPD-POLICY   | INSURADM                                        |
| INVENTORY       | Medium | Direct   | ADD-ITEM, UPD-STOCK      | INVENTORY                                       |

Reasoning:
- Each program listed directly implements a business function required by the user story.
- Impact scores are highest for programs that are central entry points for the required business domains.
- Dependency paths reflect typical data and process flows (e.g., payroll and inventory feed into end-of-day reconciliation; customer accounts and insurance policies generate financial transactions).
- All identified programs are essential for benchmarking modernization tools, as they cover the breadth of legacy mainframe business logic described in the user story.
- No unrelated programs are included, and only direct business logic flows are considered, as per the user story and benchmark suite requirements.
