Reasoning:
- `PORTUPDT.cbl` is the main entry for portfolio updates and will be responsible for ingesting and applying real-time price updates, recalculating valuations, and handling error conditions.
- `PORTFLIO.cpy` is the shared portfolio data structure, which must be extended to store new price and timestamp fields, and possibly historical price records.
- `RPTAUD00.cbl` is the batch audit report generator, which must be updated to log feed failures, outdated prices, and all price update events.
- `AUDITLOG.cpy` is the shared audit log structure, which must be extended to support new audit fields for this feature.

No unrelated files or medium/low impact components are included. All file paths are as in the repository. No new files are created; all changes are scoped to existing components.
