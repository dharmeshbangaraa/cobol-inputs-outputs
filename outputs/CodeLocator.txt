User Story: Add Transaction Type Field to Batch Processing and Reporting  
Title:  
Add Transaction Type field to transaction processing and reporting in COBOL portfolio system

As a  
Portfolio operations analyst

I want to  
record and display the type of each transaction (e.g., BUY, SELL, DIVIDEND) in both processing and reporting programs

So that  
I can track, analyze, and report on different types of portfolio transactions for compliance and business insights

Acceptance Criteria  
Data Structure Update

Add a new field, TRANSACTION-TYPE (PIC X(10)), to the transaction record layout in the relevant copybook used by both the batch processing and reporting programs.

Batch Processing Program Update

Update the transaction processing COBOL program (e.g., TRNVAL00.cbl or similar) to:

Accept, store, and process the new transaction type field when reading or writing transaction records.

Reporting Program Update

Update the transaction report COBOL program (e.g., RPTPOS00.cbl or similar) to:

Read and display the transaction type in the generated summary report.

Backward Compatibility

If the transaction type is missing for older records, the programs should handle it gracefully (e.g., display as blank or "UNKNOWN" in reports).

## 1. Summary

**User Story:**  
Add Transaction Type field to transaction processing and reporting in COBOL portfolio system

**Overview:**  
A new field, `TRANSACTION-TYPE` (PIC X(10)), must be added to the transaction record layout in the relevant copybook. Batch processing and reporting programs must be updated to accept, store, process, and display this new field, with backward compatibility for older records.

- **Total impacted components:** 5 programs, 1 copybook
- **Change complexity:** Medium–High (core data structure change with ripple effects across batch processing, reporting, and validation)

**Reasoning:**  
- `TRNREC.cpy` is the single point of definition for the transaction record. All programs that include this copybook must be updated to handle the new field.
- `RPTPOS00.cbl` and `PORTTRAN.cbl` are the main reporting and batch processing programs, directly affected by the new field for both processing and output.
- `UTLVAL00.cbl` performs validation and must be updated to check the new field and handle missing data for backward compatibility.
- `HISTLD00.cbl` and `TSTGEN00.cbl` are indirectly affected as they load/generate transaction records and must be aware of the new field for completeness and test coverage.

**Conditional Paths:**  
- All programs must handle cases where the new field is missing (older records), displaying as blank or "UNKNOWN" as specified.
