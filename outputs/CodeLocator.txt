**Summary**:
User Story: Add `CHANNEL-CODE` Field to Transaction File for Channel Identification in Batch Processing and Reporting

- 7 impacted components identified (**High impact only**)
- High complexity change: impacts core transaction data structures, all batch/utility/reporting programs that process transactions, and JCL controlling file layouts. Requires coordinated updates to copybooks, COBOL programs, and JCL to ensure the new field is handled throughout the batch processing and reporting chain.

**Key Notes**:
- Only files present in the repository are included.
- All listed components are directly responsible for defining, processing, or reporting on transaction data and must be updated for the new `CHANNEL-CODE` field.
- JCL is included where it controls file layouts or LRECL for transaction files.
- No unrelated or non-existent files are listed.
- All impact scores are high due to the centrality of transaction data in batch processing and reporting.

This report is ready for the next agent to proceed with implementation or further analysis.
