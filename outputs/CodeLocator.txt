**Reasoning**:
- `PORTUPDT.cbl` is the main batch update program for portfolios and is responsible for invoking audit trail logic after updates.
- `AUDPROC.cbl` is the common audit processing routine, called by batch programs to write audit records.
- `AUDITLOG.cpy` is the copybook defining the audit record/file structure, included by both `PORTUPDT` and `AUDPROC`.
- All three are tightly coupled in the audit trail flow, and any change to audit requirements or data structure will have a high impact on these components.

**Note:**  
- Only files present in the repository are included.
- Only components with a **High** impact score are listed.
- Paths are exact as per the repository structure.
