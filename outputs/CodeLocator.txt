**Reasoning**:
- `PORTUPDT.cbl` is the main entry point for portfolio updates and will require significant changes to ingest real-time price feeds, recalculate valuations, and handle errors.
- `PORTFLIO.cpy` is the shared portfolio data structure, likely needing extension for new fields (e.g., price history, timestamps).
- `RPTAUD00.cbl` is responsible for audit reporting and must be updated to log new types of events (feed failures, outdated prices, valuation updates).
- `AUDITLOG.cpy` is the shared audit log structure, which will be used by both update and reporting programs for new logging requirements.

No unrelated or medium/low impact files are included. All paths are verified to exist in the repository. No new files are created. All business logic changes are scoped to these high-impact components only.
