## Summary

**User Story:**  
Enable Real-Time Market Price Feed Integration for Dynamic Portfolio Updates

**Overview:**  
As a Portfolio Manager, I want the system to receive and process real-time market price updates from an external source so that portfolio valuations and risk metrics are consistently accurate and reflect the most current market conditions.

**Total High-Impact Components Identified:** 5

**High-Level Assessment:**  
This change is of high complexity, affecting core data ingestion, valuation, error handling, and audit logging components. It requires integration with external data sources, real-time processing, and robust error management.

**Reasoning Behind Each Component:**

- **RCVPRC00.cbl:** Central to real-time price feed ingestion and recovery, directly processes incoming data and triggers downstream updates.
- **BCHCTL00.cbl:** Ensures batch control and status updates are correctly managed for dynamic price integration.
- **RPTAUD00.cbl:** Responsible for audit logging and reporting, critical for compliance and historical tracking of price updates.
- **ERRPROC.cbl:** Manages error handling and logging, essential for alerting and system reliability in case of feed failures.
- **AUDITLOG.cpy:** Shared copybook structuring audit log records, used by multiple programs for consistent event tracking.
