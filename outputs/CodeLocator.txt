**Summary**:
User Story: Integrate real-time market price feed for dynamic portfolio valuation  
- 5 impacted components identified (**High impact only**)  
- High complexity change involving real-time data ingestion, position valuation recalculation, audit/error handling, and historical price persistence. Impacts core portfolio, position, and audit logic, as well as VSAM and copybook structures.

**Reasoning**:
- `PORTVAL.cbl` is the main program for portfolio valuation and must be updated to consume the real-time feed and trigger recalculation.
- `POSVAL.cbl` is directly responsible for position-level value and P&L updates, which are recalculated on each price update.
- `AUDPROC.cbl` and `AUDITLOG.cpy` are central to error handling and audit requirements for feed failures and stale data.
- `HISTLD00.cbl` is responsible for loading historical price data into the new VSAM KSDS `PRICEHIST` as required for backtesting.
- Only these components are directly and critically involved in the new real-time valuation and audit logic per the user story and acceptance criteria.
- All file paths are verified as present in the repository; no extra files are introduced.
