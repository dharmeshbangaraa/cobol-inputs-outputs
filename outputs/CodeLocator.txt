## Summary

**User Story:**  
Add `CHANNEL-CODE` Field to Transaction File for Channel Identification in Batch Processing and Reporting  
As a COBOL developer, I want to add a `CHANNEL-CODE` field to the transaction file, so that the source of each transaction (e.g., ATM, Mobile, Branch) can be captured and processed, allowing for improved analytics, auditing, and fraud detection based on transaction channels through batch processing and reporting.

- **Total impacted components:** 7 COBOL programs (batch, reporting, utility), 1 primary copybook, and associated JCL.
- **Change complexity:** High. The change affects core data structures (copybooks), file layouts, multiple batch and reporting programs, and requires LRECL/FD adjustments and test data updates.

**Reasoning:**  
- The `TRNREC.cpy` copybook is the central definition for transaction records and is included in all transaction-processing programs.
- All batch, reporting, and utility programs that read/write transaction files must update their FD, LRECL, and logic to handle the new field.
- Test data generators and validators must be updated to include and check the new field.
- JCL scripts referencing the transaction file must update LRECL and DD statements.
- Reporting and audit programs must include the new field in outputs where transaction details are shown.

**Note:**  
This analysis is based on the dependency map and structure of the COBOL-Legacy-Benchmark-Suite repository. Actual implementation may require further review of program logic and test coverage for edge cases.
