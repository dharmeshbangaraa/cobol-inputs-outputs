User Story: Add Transaction Type Field to Batch Processing and Reporting
Title:
Add Transaction Type field to transaction processing and reporting in COBOL portfolio system

As a
Portfolio operations analyst

I want to
record and display the type of each transaction (e.g., BUY, SELL, DIVIDEND) in both processing and reporting programs

So that
I can track, analyze, and report on different types of portfolio transactions for compliance and business insights

Acceptance Criteria
Data Structure Update

Add a new field, TRANSACTION-TYPE (PIC X(10)), to the transaction record layout in the relevant copybook used by both the batch processing and reporting programs.

Batch Processing Program Update

Update the transaction processing COBOL program (e.g., TRNVAL00.cbl or similar) to:

Accept, store, and process the new transaction type field when reading or writing transaction records.

Reporting Program Update

Update the transaction report COBOL program (e.g., RPTPOS00.cbl or similar) to:

Read and display the transaction type in the generated summary report.

Backward Compatibility

If the transaction type is missing for older records, the programs should handle it gracefully (e.g., display as blank or "UNKNOWN" in reports).

----------

## Summary

**User Story:** Add Transaction Type Field to Batch Processing and Reporting  
**Title:** Add Transaction Type field to transaction processing and reporting in COBOL portfolio system

**Overview:**  
A new field, TRANSACTION-TYPE (PIC X(10)), must be added to the transaction record layout (copybook) and handled in both the batch processing and reporting programs. The batch processing program must accept, store, and process this new field, while the reporting program must read and display it. Backward compatibility is required for older records.

- **Total impacted components:** 4 primary COBOL components (2 programs, 1 copybook, 1 reporting copybook), plus indirect dependencies.
- **Complexity:** Medium to High. The change affects core data structures and both processing and reporting chains, with ripple effects on validation, display, and audit logic.

### Reasoning

- **TRNREC.cpy** is the primary transaction record layout. All programs referencing this copybook will be structurally impacted by the addition of TRANSACTION-TYPE.
- **PORTTRAN.cbl** is the main batch transaction processor. It reads/writes transaction records, validates transaction type, and updates audit trails. All relevant paragraphs that reference transaction data will need updates to handle the new field and ensure backward compatibility for missing values.
- **RPTPOS00.cbl** is the main reporting program. It reads transaction records and generates reports. The report generation and formatting logic must be updated to include the new field, and handle cases where the field is missing (display blank or "UNKNOWN").
- **HISTLD00.cbl** loads transaction history and uses the transaction copybook. It will need to handle the new field for both new and legacy records.
- Other programs that use the transaction copybook or process transaction data may be impacted if they read/write the transaction record, but the above are the primary and most critical components.

**Conditional/Backward Compatibility:**  
All programs must be updated to handle cases where TRANSACTION-TYPE is missing (e.g., for legacy records). This includes defaulting to blank or "UNKNOWN" in reports and ensuring processing logic does not fail on missing values.

**False Positives Eliminated:**  
Programs that do not reference the transaction copybook or do not process/display transaction data are excluded. Only those with logical/data dependencies are included.
