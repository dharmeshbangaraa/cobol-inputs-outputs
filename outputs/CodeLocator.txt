**Summary**:
User Story: Add `CHANNEL-CODE` Field to Transaction File for Channel Identification in Batch Processing and Reporting  
- 4 high-impact components identified  
- High complexity: impacts core transaction copybook, all batch programs reading/writing transactions, file layouts, and reporting logic.

**Reasoning**:
- `TRNREC.cpy` (copybook) is the canonical transaction record definition; all transaction file structure changes must start here.
- `RPTPOS00.cbl` (batch report) reads and writes transaction files, directly referencing the transaction record structure.
- `UTLVAL00.cbl` (utility validation) processes transaction files for validation, using the transaction record structure.
- `TSTGEN00.cbl` (test data generator) creates transaction files for testing, so must be updated to generate and handle the new field.
- All these components are tightly coupled to the transaction file layout and are directly impacted by the addition of `CHANNEL-CODE`.

**Note:** Only high-impact components are listed. Other programs or JCLs that do not directly handle transaction files or do not reference the transaction record structure are excluded per instructions.
