**Key Notes:**
- Only files present in the repository are included.
- All components listed are **High impact** and are either directly responsible for, or critically dependent on, the new real-time price feed and valuation logic.
- JCL files are not listed as high impact for this user story, as the main logic and data flow changes are in the COBOL and copybook layers.
- All dependency paths and rationale are based on repository structure and dependency analysis.
