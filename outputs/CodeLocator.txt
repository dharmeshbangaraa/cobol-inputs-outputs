## Summary

**User Story:**  
Add `CHANNEL-CODE` Field to Transaction File for Channel Identification in Batch Processing and Reporting  
As a COBOL developer, I want to add a `CHANNEL-CODE` field to the transaction file, so that the source of each transaction (e.g., ATM, Mobile, Branch) can be captured and processed, allowing for improved analytics, auditing, and fraud detection based on transaction channels through batch processing and reporting.

- **Total impacted components:** 10 (programs, copybooks, JCL)
- **Change complexity:** High. This change affects core transaction data structures, file layouts, batch processing, reporting, and requires updates to copybooks, file definitions, and all programs that read/write transaction data.

**Reasoning:**  
- The core change is the addition of `CHANNEL-CODE` to the transaction file, which is defined in `TRANSACTION.CPY` and likely in `TRNREC.CPY`/`POSREC.CPY`.
- All batch, reporting, and utility programs that read/write transaction data must update their file definitions, working-storage, and logic to handle the new field.
- JCL scripts must update LRECL/FD for the new field.
- Test data generators and validators must handle the new field for completeness.
- Reporting and audit programs must include the new field in outputs and analytics.
- Impact is ranked by directness, criticality, and breadth of usage.
