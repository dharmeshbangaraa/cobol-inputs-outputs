**Summary**:
User Story: Integrate real-time market price feed for dynamic portfolio valuation  
- 5 impacted components identified (**High impact only**)  
- High complexity change involving real-time data ingestion, dynamic valuation logic, error handling, audit, and historical price persistence. Touches core position valuation, audit, and batch/reporting flows.

**Notes on Reasoning**:
- Only files present in the repository and directly tied to the user story's requirements are included.
- POSVAL00.cbl is the logical entry point for real-time price ingestion and valuation.
- POSREC.cpy is the data structure copybook for positions and P&L, updated on each price event.
- AUDPROC.cbl and AUDITLOG.cpy are responsible for error/audit logging as required by the acceptance criteria.
- HISTLD00.cbl is responsible for persisting historical price feeds into VSAM KSDS for backtesting.
- All components are ranked "High" due to their direct role in the new or modified business logic, data flow, or error handling for real-time valuation.
