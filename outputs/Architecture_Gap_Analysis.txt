- New third-party analytics integration not specified in architecture
- Additional product recommendation engine not in original design
- Custom caching solution not aligned with architectural guidelines
- Mobile-specific API endpoints not documented in architecture
- Social media authentication options not in security specifications

### 2. Architecture Documentation Gaps
- Missing performance specifications for high-traffic scenarios
- Incomplete security requirements for user data handling
- Outdated integration patterns for inventory management
- Lack of clear guidance on error handling strategies
- Missing specifications for multi-region deployment

- **Test Architecture Alignment**: 65% of testing strategy implemented

The shopping cart application shows significant architectural drift across multiple dimensions. The most critical gaps are in security implementation and performance optimization areas. The development team should prioritize addressing the authentication mechanisms and caching implementation to align with the documented architecture. Additionally, the architecture documentation needs updates to reflect newly implemented features like the recommendation engine and social media authentication. A collaborative effort between developers, architects, and DevOps is required to bring the implementation in line with architectural vision while updating documentation to reflect intentional deviations that add value to the system.
