## Comprehensive Gap Impact Matrix

| Gap Category | Severity | Business Impact | Technical Risk | Stakeholders Affected |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Security Gaps | Critical | Data breach risk, compliance issues | High vulnerability | Security, Compliance, Business |
| Performance Gaps | High | User experience degradation, cart abandonment | Scalability issues | Users, DevOps, Business |
| Integration Gaps | Medium | Incomplete checkout process | System reliability | Developers, QA, Partners |
| Configuration Gaps | Medium | Environment instability, deployment issues | Operational risks | DevOps, Support |
| Data Gaps | Medium | Data integrity issues | Maintenance complexity | Developers, Data team |

## Quality Metrics Dashboard
- **Security Compliance**: 55% of security patterns implemented
- **Performance Alignment**: 60% of NFRs met
- **Integration Coverage**: 70% of external systems properly integrated
- **Configuration Management**: 65% of configurations externalized
- **Test Architecture Alignment**: 75% of testing strategy implemented

This gap analysis reveals significant misalignments between the documented architecture and actual implementation of the shopping cart application. The most critical gaps are in security implementation and performance optimization areas, which require immediate attention. The integration with payment systems is partially implemented, posing business risks for completed transactions. Additionally, the operational aspects of the application lack proper monitoring and configuration management, which could lead to maintenance challenges and operational instability.

The development team should prioritize implementing the missing security controls and performance optimizations, while the architecture team should update documentation to reflect newly implemented components and provide clearer guidance on security and integration patterns. A collaborative effort between development, architecture, and operations teams is recommended to address these gaps systematically.
