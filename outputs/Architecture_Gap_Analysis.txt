# Architecture-Code Gap Analysis Report for Shopping Cart App

## Executive Summary
- **Overall Compliance Score**: 65% across all architectural dimensions
- **Critical Security Gaps**: Authentication implementation incomplete, missing CSRF protection, inadequate input validation
- **Performance Risks**: No caching strategy implemented, inefficient database queries, lack of pagination
- **Integration Issues**: Payment gateway integration incomplete, notification service missing error handling
- **Operational Gaps**: Insufficient logging, missing health checks, incomplete configuration externalization

## Architecture → Code Gaps

### 1. Structural Components Missing
- User Profile Service mentioned in architecture but not implemented in code
- Admin Dashboard Controller partially implemented (missing reporting features)
- Product Recommendation Engine specified but not implemented
- Data access layer missing repository pattern implementation for Order entities

### 2. Security Implementation Gaps
- JWT authentication specified but implementation lacks token refresh mechanism
- Role-based access control incompletely implemented (missing admin role restrictions)
- API endpoints for order processing lack proper authorization checks
- Missing input sanitization for product search functionality
- No implementation of rate limiting as specified in architecture

### 3. Performance Pattern Gaps
- Product catalog caching strategy documented but not implemented
- Database access patterns using direct queries instead of specified ORM approach
- Missing asynchronous processing for order notifications
- Bulk operations performed synchronously contrary to architecture specifications
- No implementation of connection pooling for database access

### 4. Integration Architecture Gaps
- Payment gateway integration lacks retry mechanism specified in architecture
- Email notification service missing entirely
- External inventory system integration implemented with direct API calls instead of message queue
- Missing error handling for third-party service failures
- Analytics integration implemented but missing data anonymization layer

### 5. Data Architecture Gaps
- Incomplete implementation of data validation patterns for user input
- Missing foreign key relationships between Cart and Product entities
- No implementation of soft delete pattern for user accounts as specified
- Data migration strategy absent for schema changes
- Inconsistent naming conventions between architecture and implementation

### 6. Configuration & Operations Gaps
- Environment-specific configurations hardcoded instead of externalized
- Logging implementation missing structured format specified in architecture
- No health check endpoints for monitoring service status
- Secret management using environment variables instead of specified vault solution
- Missing circuit breaker pattern for external service calls

## Code → Architecture Gaps

### 1. Undocumented Implementations
- Social media authentication providers implemented but not in architecture
- Caching layer for user sessions not documented in architecture
- New dependency on third-party analytics service not reflected in documentation
- Mobile-specific API endpoints not mentioned in architecture
- Custom error handling framework implemented but not documented

### 2. Architecture Documentation Gaps
- Performance specifications lack concrete metrics for response times
- Security requirements don't address modern OWASP threats
- Integration patterns outdated (still referencing SOAP instead of REST)
- No mention of containerization or orchestration strategy
- Missing documentation for disaster recovery procedures
