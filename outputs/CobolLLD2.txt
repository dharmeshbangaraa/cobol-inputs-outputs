# Technical Document and Low-Level Design (LLD)

## 1. Introduction  
This document details the recent enhancements and logic changes made to the COBOL batch control and audit trail modules, specifically for improved handling and auditing of real-time market price feed prerequisites in batch processing. The purpose is to provide a clear, structured overview of the changes, their rationale, and their impact on the system, supporting future maintenance and onboarding.

## 2. Existing Logic and Flow  
### 2.1 Overview  
The batch control processor (`BCHCTL00`) orchestrates batch job execution, managing initialization, prerequisite checks, status updates, and termination. It interacts with the audit trail processor (`AUDPROC`) to log significant events and errors, including new requirements for real-time feed validation.

### 2.2 Detailed Logic  
- **Initialization:** Opens files, reads control records, validates process, and updates start status.
- **Prerequisite Check:** Reads control records, checks dependencies (now including real-time market price feed), and sets return codes. If prerequisites fail, logs an audit record for the feed issue.
- **Status Update:** Reads control records, updates process status (with new logic for valuation batch scheduling), and writes updated records.
- **Termination:** Updates completion status and closes files.
- **Audit Logging:** The audit processor records events, including new types for feed errors/alarms, and displays alarms for failed feeds.

## 3. Impacted Changes  
### 3.1 User Story or Analysis Report Summary  
Enhance batch control to ensure real-time market price feed availability and freshness before batch valuation. If the feed is unavailable or stale, log an audit record and display an alarm. Update audit trail definitions and logic to support new feed error/alarm records.

### 3.2 Impacted Code Changes Summary:

#### 3.2.1 Impacted Sections and Files:
- **src/programs/batch/BCHCTL00.cbl**
  - **Purpose of Changes:**  
    - Enforce real-time market price feed checks as a prerequisite for batch processing.
    - Log audit records for feed failures/staleness.
    - Update status logic for new valuation batch scheduling.
  - **Impact:**  
    - Prevents batch jobs from running with stale or missing market data.
    - Provides traceable audit records for feed issues, supporting compliance and troubleshooting.
    - Ensures batch scheduling logic aligns with new business requirements.

- **src/programs/common/AUDPROC.cbl**
  - **Purpose of Changes:**  
    - Support new audit types and statuses for feed errors/alarms.
    - Display alarms for failed feed events.
  - **Impact:**  
    - Enables detailed tracking and alerting for feed-related issues.
    - Improves operational visibility and error handling.

- **src/copybook/common/AUDITLOG.cpy**
  - **Purpose of Changes:**  
    - Add new 88-level values for feed alarm types and stale feed status.
  - **Impact:**  
    - Allows audit records to distinguish feed-related errors and alarms from other events.

### 3.3 Insertion Points  
- **BCHCTL00.cbl**
  - **2000-CHECK-PREREQUISITES** (Lines within the procedure):  
    - Enhanced logic to check for real-time price feed availability and freshness.
    - If prerequisites are not met, calls `AUDPROC` to log an audit record for the feed issue.
    - Example insertion:
      ```cobol
      *-- Change: Enhanced prerequisite check for real-time price feed integration (Impact Analysis: must ensure market feed is available and fresh before batch valuation)
      ...
      *-- Change: If prerequisites not met, log audit for stale/missing feed (Impact Analysis: error/audit handling for new feed)
      CALL 'AUDPROC' USING
          LS-JOB-NAME
          'FEED'
          'CHECK'
          'FAIL'
          SPACES
          SPACES
          SPACES
          'Market price feed unavailable or stale'
          LS-RETURN-CODE
      ```
  - **3000-UPDATE-STATUS**:  
    - Clarified logic for new valuation batch scheduling.

- **AUDPROC.cbl**
  - **2000-PROCESS-AUDIT**:  
    - Added logic to display an alarm when a feed error is logged.
    - Example insertion:
      ```cobol
      *-- Change: Support for new error and alarm records for stale/failed feeds (Impact Analysis: audit logging for feed errors/alarms)
      IF LS-TYPE = 'FEED'
          IF LS-STATUS = 'FAIL'
              DISPLAY 'ALARM: Market price feed error - ' LS-MESSAGE
          END-IF
      END-IF
      ```

- **AUDITLOG.cpy**
  - **AUD-TYPE**:  
    - Added `AUD-FEED-ALARM` value 'FEED'.
  - **AUD-STATUS**:  
    - Added `AUD-STALE-FEED` value 'STAL'.

## 4. Conclusion  
The implemented changes ensure that batch processing is contingent on the availability and freshness of real-time market price feeds, with robust audit logging and alarm capabilities for any feed-related issues. These enhancements improve operational reliability, traceability, and compliance, and provide a clear audit trail for troubleshooting and regulatory review.
