# Technical Document and Low-Level Design (LLD)

## 1. Introduction  
This document provides a detailed explanation of the existing logic and impacted changes for the COBOL application modules: RCVPRC00, HISTLD00, RPTAUD00, CURSMGR, and the copybooks AUDITLOG and ERRHAND.  
The purpose of this document is to outline the modifications made to these modules, describe the rationale behind the changes, and provide a low-level design (LLD2) to facilitate understanding and future maintenance.

## 2. Existing Logic and Flow  
### 2.1 Overview  
The COBOL application consists of several batch and online modules responsible for processing, auditing, and managing customer and transaction data. The batch programs handle data loading, processing, and reporting, while the online module manages user interactions. Common copybooks provide shared routines for audit logging and error handling.

### 2.2 Detailed Logic  
- **RCVPRC00.cbl:** Handles batch processing of received transactions, including validation, processing, and output generation.
- **HISTLD00.cbl:** Loads historical data into the system, performing necessary transformations and validations.
- **RPTAUD00.cbl:** Generates audit reports based on transaction and system logs.
- **CURSMGR.cbl:** Manages online user sessions and cursor navigation.
- **AUDITLOG.cpy:** Provides common routines for audit logging across modules.
- **ERRHAND.cpy:** Implements standardized error handling logic.

## 3. Impacted Changes  
### 3.1 User Story or Analysis Report Summary  
The recent changes address enhancements in transaction processing, improved audit logging, and standardized error handling across batch and online modules. The goal is to ensure data integrity, traceability, and robust error management.

###3.2 Impacted Code Changes Summary:
####3.2.1 Impacted Sections and Files: 
- **RCVPRC00.cbl (src/programs/batch/RCVPRC00.cbl)**
- **HISTLD00.cbl (src/programs/batch/HISTLD00.cbl)**
- **RPTAUD00.cbl (src/programs/batch/RPTAUD00.cbl)**
- **CURSMGR.cbl (src/programs/online/CURSMGR.cbl)**
- **AUDITLOG.cpy (src/copybook/common/AUDITLOG.cpy)**
- **ERRHAND.cpy (src/copybook/common/ERRHAND.cpy)**

  - Purpose of Changes: To enhance transaction processing logic, improve audit trail completeness, and unify error handling mechanisms.
  - Impact: The changes improve system reliability, facilitate compliance with audit requirements, and reduce maintenance overhead by centralizing error handling.

### 3.3 Insertion Points  
- **RCVPRC00.cbl:**  
  - Inserted enhanced audit logging after transaction processing (e.g., after line 120).
  - Updated error handling to use ERRHAND.cpy routines (e.g., lines 150-170).
- **HISTLD00.cbl:**  
  - Added validation logic before data transformation (e.g., after line 60).
  - Integrated audit logging for data load events (e.g., after line 90).
- **RPTAUD00.cbl:**  
  - Modified report generation to include new audit fields (e.g., lines 80-110).
- **CURSMGR.cbl:**  
  - Updated session management to log user actions using AUDITLOG.cpy (e.g., after line 45).
- **AUDITLOG.cpy:**  
  - Added new routines for detailed event logging.
- **ERRHAND.cpy:**  
  - Centralized error message formatting and propagation.
