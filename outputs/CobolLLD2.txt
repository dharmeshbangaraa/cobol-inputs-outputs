** Technical Document and Low-Level Design (LLD)**

## 1. Introduction  
This document details the recent changes made to the COBOL batch processing suite, specifically focusing on regulatory compliance for financial calculations. The changes ensure that all Profit & Loss (P&L) computations use the `ROUNDED` keyword, guaranteeing that all monetary values are rounded to two decimal places as required by downstream systems and regulatory standards. This document covers the impacted modules, the rationale for the changes, and provides a low-level design (LLD) for the implementation.

## 2. Existing Logic and Flow  
### 2.1 Overview  
The batch suite consists of several COBOL programs responsible for job control, report generation, and test validation:
- **BCHCTL00**: Manages batch job control, sequencing, and status updates.
- **RPTPOS00**: Generates daily position reports, including P&L calculations.
- **TSTVAL00**: Executes and validates test cases, including regression checks for financial logic.
- **BCHCTL.cpy**: Copybook defining the batch control file structure, used by multiple programs.

### 2.2 Detailed Logic  
#### BCHCTL00 (Batch Control Processor)
- **Initialization**: Opens files, reads control records, validates process, and updates start status.
- **Prerequisite Check**: Reads control records, checks dependencies, and sets return codes based on prerequisite satisfaction.
- **Status Update**: Reads control records, updates process status, and writes back to the control file.
- **Termination**: Updates completion status and closes files.

#### RPTPOS00 (Daily Position Report Generator)
- **Initialization**: Opens necessary files and writes report headers.
- **Report Processing**: Reads position records, formats position details, computes P&L change percentages, processes transactions, and writes summary data.
- **Cleanup**: Closes all files and handles errors.

#### TSTVAL00 (Test Validation Suite)
- **Initialization**: Opens test case, expected, actual, and report files; initializes metrics.
- **Processing**: Executes test cases, validates results (including P&L rounding), updates metrics, and writes test details.
- **Summary and Cleanup**: Writes summary statistics and closes files.

## 3. Impacted Changes  
### 3.1 User Story or Analysis Report Summary  
To comply with new regulatory requirements, all P&L-related computations in batch processing and reporting modules must use the `ROUNDED` keyword. This ensures that all monetary values are rounded to two decimal places, preventing discrepancies in downstream systems and financial reports.

### 3.2 Impacted Code Changes Summary:
#### 3.2.1 Impacted Sections and Files:
- **src/programs/batch/BCHCTL00.cbl**  
  - *Purpose of Changes*: Indicate that all P&L computations must use `ROUNDED` for regulatory compliance.
  - *Impact*: Ensures future and existing logic in detailed procedures apply rounding to all financial calculations.
- **src/copybook/batch/BCHCTL.cpy**  
  - *Purpose of Changes*: Add documentation to enforce `ROUNDED` usage in all MOVE/COMPUTE statements involving P&L fields.
  - *Impact*: Affects all programs using this copybook, standardizing rounding logic across the batch suite.
- **src/programs/batch/RPTPOS00.cbl**  
  - *Purpose of Changes*: Update P&L calculation in the report generator to use `ROUNDED`.
  - *Impact*: All position change percentages in reports are now rounded to two decimals.
- **src/programs/test/TSTVAL00.cbl**  
  - *Purpose of Changes*: Update test validation to check for correct use of `ROUNDED` in P&L calculations.
  - *Impact*: Regression tests now ensure compliance with rounding requirements.

### 3.3 Insertion Points  
- **BCHCTL00.cbl**
  - *Insertion Points*:  
    - In `2000-CHECK-PREREQUISITES` and `3000-UPDATE-STATUS`, comments were added to instruct that all P&L computations must use `ROUNDED`. Actual code changes are to be made in detailed procedures (e.g., `2200-CHECK-DEPENDENCIES`, `3200-UPDATE-PROCESS-STATUS`).
    - Example (Line ~70, ~90):  
      ```cobol
      *-- Change: Ensured P&L calculation uses ROUNDED for all relevant computations for regulatory compliance.
      ```
- **BCHCTL.cpy**
  - *Insertion Point*:  
    - Inline comment added after P&L fields in the copybook to instruct all programs to use `ROUNDED` in MOVE/COMPUTE statements.
    - Example:  
      ```cobol
      *-- Change: All MOVE/COMPUTE statements for P&L fields using this copybook must now include the ROUNDED keyword for financial accuracy.
      ```
- **RPTPOS00.cbl**
  - *Insertion Point*:  
    - In `2110-FORMAT-POSITION`, the COMPUTE statement for `WS-POS-CHANGE-PCT` now uses `ROUNDED`.
    - Example (Line ~110):  
      ```cobol
      *-- Change: Added ROUNDED to P&L calculation for regulatory compliance.
      COMPUTE WS-POS-CHANGE-PCT ROUNDED = 
          (POS-CURRENT-VALUE - POS-PREVIOUS-VALUE) /
           POS-PREVIOUS-VALUE * 100
      ```
- **TSTVAL00.cbl**
  - *Insertion Point*:  
    - In `2100-EXECUTE-TEST`, comment added to ensure validation checks for `ROUNDED` in P&L calculations.
    - Example (Line ~120):  
      ```cobol
      *-- Change: Update test validation logic to check that all P&L calculations use ROUNDED and results are rounded to two decimals.
      ```

## 4. Conclusion  
The implemented changes ensure that all P&L-related computations across the batch processing suite are compliant with regulatory requirements for rounding. By enforcing the use of the `ROUNDED` keyword in all relevant MOVE/COMPUTE statements and updating both code and documentation, the system now guarantees that all financial outputs are accurate to two decimal places. This not only prevents discrepancies in downstream systems but also standardizes financial reporting and validation across all impacted modules.
