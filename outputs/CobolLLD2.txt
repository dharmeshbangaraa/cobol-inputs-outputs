# Technical Document and Low-Level Design (LLD)

## 1. Introduction  
This document details the technical changes and low-level design (LLD2) for the COBOL application modules impacted by the integration of real-time price feed and market data ingestion, as well as enhanced audit logging and reporting. The changes span portfolio update processing, batch recovery, audit logging, and audit reporting components. The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the modifications, their rationale, and their implementation details for developers, testers, and maintainers.

## 2. Existing Logic and Flow  
### 2.1 Overview  
The application suite manages portfolio records, processes batch updates, handles recovery operations, and generates audit reports. The main modules are:

- **PORTUPDT.cbl**: Updates portfolio records based on update files.
- **RCVPRC00.cbl**: Handles batch recovery and now ingests real-time market data.
- **AUDITLOG.cpy**: Defines the audit trail record structure.
- **RPTAUD00.cbl**: Generates audit reports, now including price feed and error events.

### 2.2 Detailed Logic  

#### PORTUPDT.cbl  
- **Initialization**: Opens portfolio, update, price feed, and audit files.  
- **Price Feed Processing**: Reads real-time price feed records, updates portfolio values, and logs audit events.  
- **Update Processing**: Applies updates from the update file to portfolio records and logs audit events.  
- **Termination**: Closes all files and displays processing statistics.

#### RCVPRC00.cbl  
- **Market Data Polling**: Polls the market feed file, logs each event to the audit log, and handles errors.  
- **Recovery Processing**: Executes recovery logic based on the function code provided.

#### AUDITLOG.cpy  
- **Audit Record Structure**: Defines fields for timestamp, system, user, program, terminal, type, action, status, key info, before/after images, and message.  
- **New Types/Actions**: Adds support for price feed and price update events.

#### RPTAUD00.cbl  
- **Audit Trail Processing**: Reads audit records, identifies and counts price feed and error events, and writes detailed and summary reports.

## 3. Impacted Changes  
### 3.1 User Story or Analysis Report Summary  
- Integrate real-time price feed and market data ingestion into portfolio and batch processing.
- Enhance audit logging to capture price feed and error events.
- Update audit reporting to include new event types and provide summary statistics.

### 3.2 Impacted Code Changes Summary:

#### 3.2.1 Impacted Sections and Files:
- **src/programs/portfolio/PORTUPDT.cbl**
- **src/programs/batch/RCVPRC00.cbl**
- **src/copybook/common/AUDITLOG.cpy**
- **src/programs/batch/RPTAUD00.cbl**

  - **Purpose of Changes:**  
    - Enable ingestion and processing of real-time price/market data.
    - Provide comprehensive audit logging for all new events and errors.
    - Enhance reporting to reflect new audit event types.

  - **Impact:**  
    - Improved data accuracy and timeliness in portfolio valuations.
    - Enhanced traceability and compliance via detailed audit logs.
    - Better operational insight through enriched audit reports.

### 3.3 Insertion Points  
- **PORTUPDT.cbl**
  - File-control and file section: Add `PRICEFEED-FILE` and `AUDIT-FILE`.
  - Working-storage: Add status and counters for new files.
  - Procedure division:  
    - After initialization, insert `PERFORM 1500-PROCESS-PRICEFEED`.
    - Add new paragraphs: `1500-PROCESS-PRICEFEED`, `2400-WRITE-AUDIT-PRICEUPDATE`, `2500-WRITE-AUDIT-ERROR`.
    - Update `3000-TERMINATE` to close new files.

- **RCVPRC00.cbl**
  - File-control and file section: Add `MARKET-FEED-FILE` and `AUDIT-FILE`.
  - Working-storage: Add status and counters for new files.
  - Procedure division:  
    - At start, insert `PERFORM 0500-POLL-MARKET-FEED`.
    - Add new paragraphs: `0500-POLL-MARKET-FEED`, `0550-WRITE-AUDIT-MKTFEED`, `9500-WRITE-AUDIT-ERROR`.

- **AUDITLOG.cpy**
  - Add new 88-level values for `AUD-TYPE` (`AUD-PRICE-FEED`) and `AUD-ACTION` (`AUD-PRICE-UPDATE`).

- **RPTAUD00.cbl**
  - Working-storage: Add counters for price feed and error events.
  - Procedure division:  
    - In audit trail processing, add logic to count and report new event types.
    - Add summary lines for new event types.
