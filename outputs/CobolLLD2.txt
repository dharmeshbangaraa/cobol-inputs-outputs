# Technical Document and Low-Level Design (LLD)

## 1. Introduction  
This document provides a detailed explanation of the existing logic and structure for the COBOL modules involved in audit trail processing and historical position loading. The modules covered are critical for audit/error handling and the integration of real-time market price feeds.  
No code changes were required for these modules based on the latest Impact Analysis Report; however, this document is provided for completeness and traceability.

## 2. Existing Logic and Flow  
### 2.1 Overview  
The application consists of the following key components:
- **AUDPROC.cbl**: Handles audit trail processing, writing audit records for system and user actions.
- **AUDITLOG.cpy**: Defines the structure of audit trail records.
- **HISTLD00.cbl**: Loads historical position data into DB2, maintaining batch control and error handling.

### 2.2 Detailed Logic  

#### **AUDPROC.cbl**  
- **Initialization (Lines 38-50):**  
  - Accepts the current timestamp.
  - Opens the audit file for extension.
  - Handles file open errors by setting a return code and terminating.
- **Audit Processing (Lines 52-73):**  
  - Initializes the audit record.
  - Populates audit fields from the linkage section.
  - Writes the audit record to the file.
  - Handles write errors and sets appropriate return codes.
- **Termination (Lines 75-77):**  
  - Closes the audit file.

#### **AUDITLOG.cpy**  
- Defines the structure of an audit record, including header information, action types, status codes, key info, before/after images, and messages.
- Utilizes level-88 condition names for common values (e.g., action types, status).

#### **HISTLD00.cbl**  
- **Initialization (Lines 38-50):**  
  - Opens input and control files.
  - Connects to DB2.
  - Initializes checkpoints using the batch control file.
- **Processing Loop (Lines 52-62):**  
  - Reads transaction history records.
  - Loads each record into the DB2 POSHIST table.
  - Handles duplicate keys and errors.
  - Commits work at defined thresholds and updates checkpoints.
- **Termination (Lines 64-77):**  
  - Final commit and checkpoint update.
  - Closes files and disconnects from DB2.
  - Displays processing statistics.
- **Error Handling (Lines 79-87):**  
  - Calls a common error routine and rolls back DB2 work on error.

## 3. Impacted Changes  
### 3.1 User Story or Analysis Report Summary  
No changes were required for these files based on the Impact Analysis Report. The files are included for completeness as they are directly involved in audit/error handling and historical price tick loading for real-time market price feed integration.

### 3.2 Impacted Code Changes Summary:
#### 3.2.1 Impacted Sections and Files:
- **AUDPROC.cbl** (`src/programs/common/AUDPROC.cbl`)
- **AUDITLOG.cpy** (`src/copybook/common/AUDITLOG.cpy`)
- **HISTLD00.cbl** (`src/programs/batch/HISTLD00.cbl`)

  - **Purpose of Changes:**  
    No changes were made. The modules are included due to their direct involvement in the integration of real-time market price feeds and related audit/error handling.
  - **Impact:**  
    No impact on system logic or data flow. The existing logic continues to support audit trail processing and historical data loading as required.

### 3.3 Insertion Points  
- **No new logic was inserted.**  
- All existing logic remains unchanged.  
- The files and sections listed above are referenced for completeness and traceability.

### 3.4 Structured Diffs  
**No code changes were made.**  
For reference, the structure of the modules remains as follows:

**AUDPROC.cbl (Excerpt):**
```cobol
1000-INITIALIZE.
    ACCEPT WS-FORMATTED-TIME FROM TIME STAMP
    OPEN EXTEND AUDIT-FILE
    IF WS-FILE-STATUS NOT = '00'
        DISPLAY 'Error opening audit file: ' WS-FILE-STATUS
        MOVE 8 TO LS-RETURN-CODE
        PERFORM 3000-TERMINATE
        GOBACK
    END-IF
.
```

**AUDITLOG.cpy (Excerpt):**
```cobol
01  AUDIT-RECORD.
    05  AUD-HEADER.
        10  AUD-TIMESTAMP     PIC X(26).
        10  AUD-SYSTEM-ID     PIC X(8).
        10  AUD-USER-ID       PIC X(8).
        10  AUD-PROGRAM       PIC X(8).
        10  AUD-TERMINAL      PIC X(8).
    05  AUD-TYPE             PIC X(4).
        88  AUD-TRANSACTION     VALUE 'TRAN'.
        88  AUD-USER-ACTION     VALUE 'USER'.
        88  AUD-SYSTEM-EVENT    VALUE 'SYST'.
    ...
```

**HISTLD00.cbl (Excerpt):**
```cobol
2200-LOAD-TO-DB2.
    INITIALIZE POSHIST-RECORD
    MOVE TH-ACCOUNT-NO    TO PH-ACCOUNT-NO
    MOVE TH-PORTFOLIO-ID  TO PH-PORTFOLIO-ID
    ...
    EXEC SQL
        INSERT INTO POSHIST
        VALUES (:POSHIST-RECORD)
    END-EXEC
    IF SQLCODE = 0
        ADD 1 TO WS-RECORDS-WRITTEN
    ELSE
        IF SQLCODE = -803
            CONTINUE
        ELSE
            ADD 1 TO WS-ERROR-COUNT
            PERFORM DB2-ERROR-ROUTINE
        END-IF
    END-IF
.
```

## 4. Conclusion  
No changes were made to the audit trail processing or historical position loading modules as a result of the latest impact analysis. The existing logic continues to provide robust support for audit/error handling and real-time market price feed integration. This document serves as a reference for the current state of these modules and ensures traceability for future enhancements or debugging efforts.
