# Technical Document and Low-Level Design (LLD)

## 1. Introduction  
This document details the recent enhancements made to the COBOL transaction processing suite, specifically the addition of the `CHANNEL-CODE` field for channel identification (ATM, MOBL, BRCH, NETB) across transaction records and related programs. The purpose of this document is to provide a clear understanding of the changes, their rationale, and the low-level design for implementation and maintenance.

## 2. Existing Logic and Flow  
### 2.1 Overview  
The COBOL application suite processes financial transactions, validates input data, generates test data, and produces audit and reporting outputs. The system reads transaction records from a sequential file, processes them according to business rules, and outputs results for reporting, validation, and auditing.

### 2.2 Detailed Logic  
- **Transaction Record Structure:**  
  The transaction record is defined in `TRANSACTION.CPY` and is used throughout the application for consistency.
- **Processing Programs:**  
  - `RPTPOS00.CBL`: Reads transactions and outputs channel information for reporting.
  - `UTLVAL00.CBL`: Validates transaction records, including the new channel code.
  - `TSTGEN00.CBL`: Generates test transaction records with all valid channel codes.
  - `TSTVAL00.CBL`: Reads and displays channel codes for test validation.
  - `RPTAUD00.CBL`: Outputs audit information, including the channel code.
- **JCL Updates:**  
  All relevant JCL scripts have been updated to reflect the new logical record length (LRECL) due to the addition of the `CHANNEL-CODE` field.

#### Flowchart:

```

## 3. Impacted Changes  
### 3.1 User Story or Analysis Report Summary  
Enhance transaction processing and reporting by introducing a `CHANNEL-CODE` field to identify the source channel (ATM, MOBL, BRCH, NETB) for each transaction. Update all related copybooks, programs, and JCL to support this new field for improved reporting, validation, and auditing.

### 3.2 Impacted Code Changes Summary:
#### 3.2.1 Impacted Sections and Files:
- **Copybooks:**
  - `/copybooks/TRANSACTION.CPY`
  - `/copybooks/POSREC.CPY`
- **Programs:**
  - `/programs/RPTPOS00.CBL`
  - `/programs/UTLVAL00.CBL`
  - `/programs/TSTGEN00.CBL`
  - `/programs/TSTVAL00.CBL`
  - `/programs/RPTAUD00.CBL`
- **JCL:**
  - `/jcl/RPTPOS00.JCL`
  - `/jcl/UTLVAL00.JCL`
  - `/jcl/TSTGEN00.JCL`
  - `/jcl/TSTVAL00.JCL`

- **Purpose of Changes:**  
  To enable the identification and processing of transactions by their originating channel, supporting enhanced reporting, validation, and audit capabilities.

- **Impact:**  
  - All transaction records now include a 4-character `CHANNEL-CODE`.
  - Programs have been updated to read, write, validate, and display the new field.
  - JCL scripts have been updated to accommodate the increased record length.
  - Downstream processes and reports can now segment data by channel, improving analytics and compliance.

### 3.3 Insertion Points  
- **Copybooks:**  
  - `TRANSACTION.CPY` and `POSREC.CPY`:  
    - Inserted `05  CHANNEL-CODE PIC X(04).` after `TRANSACTION-STATUS`/`POS-STATUS`.
- **Programs:**  
  - All programs using the transaction record now reference the new `CHANNEL-CODE` field.
  - New working-storage variables for channel code handling (e.g., `WS-CHANNEL-CODE`).
  - Logic added to move, validate, and display the channel code in processing sections.
- **JCL:**  
  - All JCL scripts referencing `TRANSACT.DAT` updated to `LRECL=68` to match the new record length.

**References to specific code sections:**
- Copybook field addition: After the status field in both copybooks.
- Working-storage additions: After EOF flags in each program.
- Processing logic: In main processing PERFORM loops, after reading a record.

### 3.4 Structured Diffs  
**TRANSACTION.CPY / POSREC.CPY**  
_Before:_
```cobol
       01  TRANSACTION-RECORD.
           05  TRANSACTION-ID         PIC 9(10).

```

**Program Example (RPTPOS00.CBL, similar in others):**  
_Before:_
```cobol
       77  WS-EOF                PIC X VALUE 'N'.

       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       2200-PROCESS-TRANSACTIONS.
           PERFORM UNTIL WS-EOF = 'Y'
               READ TRANSACTION-FILE
                   AT END
                       MOVE 'Y' TO WS-EOF
                   NOT AT END
                       DISPLAY 'TRANSACTION: ' TRANSACTION-ID
               END-READ
           END-PERFORM.
```
_After:_
```cobol
       77  WS-EOF                PIC X VALUE 'N'.
       77  WS-CHANNEL-CODE       PIC X(04).  * Added for channel reporting

       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       2200-PROCESS-TRANSACTIONS.
           PERFORM UNTIL WS-EOF = 'Y'
               READ TRANSACTION-FILE
                   AT END
                       MOVE 'Y' TO WS-EOF
                   NOT AT END
                       MOVE CHANNEL-CODE TO WS-CHANNEL-CODE  * Capture channel code
                       DISPLAY 'TRANSACTION: ' TRANSACTION-ID ' CHANNEL: ' CHANNEL-CODE  * Output channel code
               END-READ
           END-PERFORM.
```

**JCL Example (RPTPOS00.JCL, similar in others):**  
_Before:_
```jcl
//INFILE   DD DSN=TRANSACT.DAT,DISP=SHR,LRECL=64,RECFM=FB
```
_After:_
```jcl
//INFILE   DD DSN=TRANSACT.DAT,DISP=SHR,LRECL=68,RECFM=FB  // Updated LRECL for CHANNEL-CODE
```

## 4. Conclusion  
The addition of the `CHANNEL-CODE` field across transaction processing components enables the system to identify and process transactions by their originating channel. This enhancement supports improved reporting, validation, and auditing, and positions the application for future channel-based analytics and compliance requirements. All impacted copybooks, programs, and JCL have been updated to ensure consistency and correctness throughout the transaction lifecycle.
