# Technical Document and Low-Level Design (LLD)

## 1. Introduction  
This document details the technical changes and low-level design (LLD) for recent modifications to the COBOL application modules responsible for position reporting, audit reporting, and test validation. The primary focus is on ensuring that Profit & Loss (P&L) values are rounded to two decimals in the daily position report, as per new business requirements. This document provides an overview of the existing logic, a summary of impacted changes, insertion points, structured diffs, and the rationale behind the modifications.

## 2. Existing Logic and Flow  
### 2.1 Overview  
The COBOL application suite consists of several modules:
- **RPTPOS00**: Generates the daily position report, summarizing portfolio positions, transaction activity, exceptions, and performance metrics.
- **RPTAUD00**: Produces comprehensive audit reports, including security and process audit trails, error summaries, and control verification.
- **TSTVAL00**: Executes test validation suites, validating test results, error conditions, and performance benchmarks.

### 2.2 Detailed Logic  
#### RPTPOS00 (Daily Position Report Generator)
- **Initialization (Lines 50-80):** Opens required files and writes report headers.
- **Processing (Lines 81-200):** 
  - Reads position records.
  - Formats and writes position details, including P&L calculations.
  - Processes transaction history and summarizes activity.
  - Writes summary, exceptions, and performance metrics.
- **Cleanup (Lines 201-220):** Closes all files and handles errors.

## 3. Impacted Changes  
### 3.1 User Story or Analysis Report Summary  
**Business Requirement:**  
Ensure that all P&L values reported in the daily position report are rounded to two decimal places to comply with financial reporting standards and improve report accuracy.

### 3.2 Impacted Code Changes Summary:
#### 3.2.1 Impacted Sections and Files:
- **File:** `src/programs/batch/RPTPOS00.cbl`
  - **Section:** `2110-FORMAT-POSITION`
  - **Purpose of Changes:** To guarantee that P&L values (specifically, current position values) are rounded to two decimals when written to the report.
  - **Impact:** This change ensures consistency and accuracy in financial reporting, aligning with business and audit requirements. No other modules required code changes, but recommendations were made for future logic involving P&L values.

### 3.3 Insertion Points  
- **File:** `src/programs/batch/RPTPOS00.cbl`
- **Section:** `2110-FORMAT-POSITION`
- **Insertion Point:** After computing the percentage change in position value, the logic for moving the current value to the report field is updated to use the `ROUNDED` keyword.
- **Line Reference:** Immediately after the `COMPUTE WS-POS-CHANGE-PCT` statement.

**Description:**  
The `MOVE` statement for `POS-CURRENT-VALUE` to `WS-POS-VALUE` is modified to include the `ROUNDED` keyword, ensuring the value is rounded to two decimals before being written to the report.

**Rationale:**  
Financial reports require values to be rounded to two decimals for compliance and clarity. This change directly addresses that requirement for all position values reported.

### 3.4 Structured Diffs  
**Before:**  
```cobol
           COMPUTE WS-POS-CHANGE-PCT = 
               (POS-CURRENT-VALUE - POS-PREVIOUS-VALUE) /
                POS-PREVIOUS-VALUE * 100
           *-- Begin Change: Ensure P&L values are rounded to two decimals
           MOVE POS-CURRENT-VALUE TO WS-POS-VALUE
           *-- End Change
           WRITE REPORT-RECORD FROM WS-POSITION-DETAIL.
```

**After:**  
```cobol
           COMPUTE WS-POS-CHANGE-PCT = 
               (POS-CURRENT-VALUE - POS-PREVIOUS-VALUE) /
                POS-PREVIOUS-VALUE * 100
           *-- Begin Change: Ensure P&L values are rounded to two decimals
           MOVE POS-CURRENT-VALUE TO WS-POS-VALUE ROUNDED
           *-- End Change
           WRITE REPORT-RECORD FROM WS-POSITION-DETAIL.
```

## 4. Conclusion  
The implemented change in `RPTPOS00.cbl` ensures that all P&L values in the daily position report are rounded to two decimals, meeting business and audit requirements for financial reporting. No code changes were necessary in other modules, but recommendations have been documented for future enhancements involving P&L calculations. This update improves the accuracy and compliance of the reporting process, with minimal impact on existing logic and performance.
