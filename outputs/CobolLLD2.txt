# Technical Document and Low-Level Design (LLD)

## 1. Introduction  
This document was intended to provide a detailed explanation of the existing logic and impacted changes for the COBOL application modules specified. The purpose was to analyze code modifications, document logic changes, and generate a low-level design (LLD2) based on the provided COBOL code changes.

## 2. Existing Logic and Flow  
### 2.1 Overview  
The COBOL application modules in question could not be analyzed as the requested source files were not found in the repository at the specified paths.

### 2.2 Detailed Logic  
No analysis of existing logic or flow could be performed due to the absence of the required COBOL source files.  
#### Flowchart:  
```

    Start(["Start"])
    Error["Requested COBOL
files not found"]
    End(["End"])

    Start --> Error
    Error --> End
```

## 3. Impacted Changes  
### 3.1 User Story or Analysis Report Summary  
No user story or analysis report summary can be provided as no code changes were available for review.

### 3.2 Impacted Code Changes Summary:
#### 3.2.1 Impacted Sections and Files: 
  - None of the requested files were found in the repository.
  - Purpose of Changes: Not applicable.
  - Impact: Not applicable.

### 3.3 Insertion Points  
No insertion points could be identified due to the absence of the required COBOL source files.

### 3.4 Structured Diffs  
No structured diffs can be provided as no code changes were available.

## 4. Conclusion  
The requested COBOL source files (src/programs/batch/POSUPDT.cbl, src/programs/online/PORTDISP.cbl, src/programs/batch/HISTLD00.cbl, src/programs/common/AUDPROC.cbl, src/copybook/db2/PRICEDATA.cpy, src/copybook/common/AUDITLOG.cpy, src/programs/batch/PORTVAL.cbl) could not be found in the repository at the specified paths. As a result, no technical documentation or low-level design (LLD2) could be generated. Please verify the file paths, filenames, or branch, or provide updated information so the required COBOL modifications and documentation can be performed.
