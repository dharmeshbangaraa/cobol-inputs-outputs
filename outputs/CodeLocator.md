- All nodes and edges shown are **High Impact** only.

**Reasoning**:

- `src/copybook/common/TRNREC.cpy` is the central copybook for transaction records; adding `CHANNEL-CODE` here is the core change.
- `src/programs/batch/RPTPOS00.cbl` and `src/programs/utility/UTLVAL00.cbl` both directly use `TRNREC.cpy` and process transaction files, so they must be updated to handle the new field in file I/O, validation, and reporting.
- Only these components are marked as **High Impact** because they are directly responsible for transaction record structure and processing. All other programs/copybooks are either unrelated or only indirectly affected (medium/low impact).
