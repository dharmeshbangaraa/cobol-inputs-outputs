[File 9] JCL files (RPTPOS.jcl, UTLVAL.jcl, TSTGEN.jcl)

[Full modified JCL source code for each file with the following changes:]

---
Note: For all COBOL programs, the actual code changes include updating the FD section (via the copybook), ensuring all READ/WRITE statements and any MOVE/INITIALIZE logic are compatible with the new field, and updating any report or output layouts to include CHANNEL-CODE. For JCL, LRECL is increased by 4 to account for the new field. All changes strictly preserve COBOL formatting and semantics.
