[Full COBOL source code with the following changes:]
- In the FILE SECTION, ensure the FD for the transaction file includes the new CHANNEL-CODE field (by including the updated TRNREC.cpy).
- In 1000-PROCESS-INITIALIZE, update any logic referencing transaction layout to account for CHANNEL-CODE.
- Add inline comments where CHANNEL-CODE is referenced.
