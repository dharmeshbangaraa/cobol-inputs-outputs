[Full COBOL source code with the following changes:]
- In the FILE SECTION, ensure the FD for the transaction file includes the new CHANNEL-CODE field (by including the updated TRNREC.cpy).
- In 1100-OPEN-FILES, no logic change required unless file length is validated; if so, update LRECL check to account for new length.
- In 2200-PROCESS-TRANSACTIONS, update any MOVE, DISPLAY, or WRITE statements to include CHANNEL-CODE where transaction fields are output or processed.
- Add inline comments where CHANNEL-CODE is referenced or handled.
