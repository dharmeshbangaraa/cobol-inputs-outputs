Title: Enable Real-Time Market Price Feed Integration for Dynamic Portfolio Updates

User Story:
As a Portfolio Manager
I want the system to receive and process real-time market price updates from an external source
so that portfolio valuations and risk metrics are consistently accurate and reflect the most current market conditions.

Acceptance Criteria:
Data Ingestion: The system connects to an external market-data provider via supported protocols (e.g., MQ or REST) and polls for price updates every 5 seconds.
Valuation Updates: Upon receiving a price update, the system recalculates position values and associated profit/loss metrics, and records the update with a timestamp.
Error Handling & Logging: If the data feed fails or prices become outdated for more than 30 seconds, an alert is triggered and an entry is written to an audit log.
The system also maintains a historical record of received prices for analysis and reporting.
