Title: Integrate real-time market price feed for dynamic portfolio valuation

User Story:
As a Portfolio Manager
I want the system to consume and apply real-time market price updates from an external data provider
so that my portfolio valuations and risk metrics are always up-to-date, enabling faster and more accurate trading decisions.

Acceptance Criteria:
	1. Data Ingestion: The application connects to the external market-data API via MQ or REST every 5 seconds.
	Incoming price ticks for all securities held in a portfolio are mapped to the DB2 PRICEDATA table.
	2. Valuation Engine: On each price update, the batch job recalculates position values in corresponding cobol file and updates to corresponding cobol file.
	Position P&L is recalculated and stored with a timestamp.
	3. Online Display: The CICS screen for “View Portfolio” automatically refreshes to show current valuations within 10 seconds of the last price update.
	4. Error Handling & Audit: If the feed fails or prices are stale for more than 30 seconds, the system raises a UDF-level alarm and writes to AUDITLOG.
	Historical price feeds are persisted in a new VSAM KSDS PRICEHIST for backtesting.
	5. Performance & Scalability: System sustains up to 1,000 price updates per second without impacting batch-window SLAs.
	Capacity planning documentation is updated to reflect new throughput and storage requirements.
