Title: Integrate real-time market price feed for dynamic portfolio valuation

User Story:
As a Portfolio Manager
I want the system to consume and apply real-time market price updates from an external data provider
so that my portfolio valuations and risk metrics are always up-to-date, enabling faster and more accurate trading decisions.

Acceptance Criteria:
	1. Data Ingestion: The application connects to the external market-data API via MQ or REST every 5 seconds.
	2. On each price update, create a method to recaluclate the position value in a correspoding cobol file
	Position P&L is recalculated and stored with a timestamp. Dont create a new file add the logic in exisiting cobol file only
	3. Error Handling & Audit: If the feed fails or prices are stale for more than 30 seconds, the system raises a UDF-level alarm and writes to AUDITLOG.
	Historical price feeds are persisted in a new VSAM KSDS PRICEHIST for backtesting.
	4. Performance & Scalability: System sustains up to 1,000 price updates per second without impacting batch-window SLAs.
	Capacity planning documentation is updated to reflect new throughput and storage requirements.
