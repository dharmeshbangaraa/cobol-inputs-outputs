Title: Fix rounding discrepancies in portfolio P&L calculation

User Story:
As an Operations Analyst
I want all P&L values to be rounded consistently to two decimal places
so that financial reports and statements match downstream accounting systems exactly.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Calculation Logic: Update the COBOL arithmetic in PNL-CALC-PROG (or relevant copybook routines) to use ROUNDED when moving computed P&L from WORK-DIVIDE fields to output fields.
2. Data Storage: Ensure the DB2 PORTVAL.PNL_AMT column (DECIMAL(15,2)) stores values exactly with two decimal places.
3. Regression Test: Add unit tests in TSTVAL.jcl that feed known inputs (e.g., buy at 10.3333, sell at 10.6666) and expect P&L of “0.33” rather than “0.34” (or vice versa per defined rule).
4. Reporting: Verify that batch reports (RPTPOS00 and RPTAUD00) display P&L amounts correctly rounded in both TXT and CSV outputs.
