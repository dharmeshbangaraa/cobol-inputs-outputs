Title: Add `CHANNEL-CODE` Field to Transaction File for Channel Identification in Batch Processing and Reporting

User Story:
As a COBOL developer,
I want to add a `CHANNEL-CODE` field to the transaction file,
so that the source of each transaction (e.g., ATM, Mobile, Branch) can be captured and processed,
allowing for improved analytics, auditing, and fraud detection based on transaction channels through batch processing and reporting.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Definition
   A new field `CHANNEL-CODE` (`PIC X(04)`) is defined in the relevant copybooks (e.g., `TRANSACTION.CPY`).

2. File Layout
   Transaction input and output files are updated to include the `CHANNEL-CODE` field and corresponding layout adjustments.

3. Program Updates
   All programs (batch, online, utility) that read or write transaction data are updated to handle the new field appropriately.

4. Test Data
   Sample input files and test data include valid `CHANNEL-CODE` values (e.g., `BRCH`, `ATM`, `MOBL`, `NETB`).

5. LRECL & FD Adjustments
   The LRECL (Logical Record Length) and FD (File Description) entries in COBOL programs and JCL are adjusted to reflect the new field.

6. Documentation
   The data dictionary and all relevant documentation are updated to reflect the structure and purpose of `CHANNEL-CODE`.

7. Reporting
   Any reports or logs that output transaction details include the `CHANNEL-CODE` field where applicable.
