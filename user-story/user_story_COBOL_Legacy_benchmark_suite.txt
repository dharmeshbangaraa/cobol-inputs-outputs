Title: Fix rounding discrepancies in portfolio P&L calculation in Batch Processing and Reporting modules only.

User Story:
As an Operations Analyst
I want all P&L values to be rounded consistently to two decimal places
so that financial reports and statements match downstream accounting systems exactly.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Calculation Logic: Update the COBOL arithmetic in PNL-CALC-PROG (or relevant copybook routines) to use ROUNDED when moving computed P&L from WORK-DIVIDE fields to output fields.
2. Reporting: Verify that batch reports (RPTPOS00 and RPTAUD00) display P&L amounts correctly rounded in both TXT and CSV outputs.
