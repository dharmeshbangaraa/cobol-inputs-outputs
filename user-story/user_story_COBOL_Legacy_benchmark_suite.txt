Title: Fix rounding discrepancies in portfolio P&L calculation in Batch processing and Reporting modules.

User Story:
As an Operations Analyst,
I want all P&L values to be rounded consistently to two decimal places,
so that financial reports and statements match downstream accounting systems exactly.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Calculation Logic:
   Update the COBOL arithmetic logic to use the ROUNDED keyword when moving computed P&L values from intermediate working fields to output fields.

2. Data Storage:
   Ensure that database fields storing P&L values (e.g., DECIMAL(15,2) columns) maintain exactly two decimal places.

3. Reporting Validation:
   Ensure that batch-generated reports display rounded P&L values consistently in all formats, including TXT and CSV.

4. Regression Test: Add unit tests in TSTVAL.jcl that feed known inputs (e.g., buy at 10.3333, sell at 10.6666) and expect P&L     of “0.33” rather than “0.34” (or vice versa per defined rule).
