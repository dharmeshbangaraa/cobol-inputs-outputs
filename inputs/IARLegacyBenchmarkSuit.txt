**Reasoning**:
- **TRNREC.cpy** is the central copybook for transaction records and will be directly modified to add the new field. All programs using this copybook are potentially impacted.
- **PORTTRAN.cbl** is the main batch program for transaction processing and directly uses TRNREC.cpy, so it must be updated to handle the new field in all relevant logic and validation.
- **RPTPOS00.cbl** is the reporting program that generates transaction reports using TRNREC.cpy, so it must be updated to read and display the new field.
- Other batch programs in the batch directory do not reference TRNREC.cpy and are not directly impacted.
- The impact is ranked high for all three components due to the direct nature of the change and its effect on core business logic and reporting.
